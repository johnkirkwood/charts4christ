<p>There was a certain Professor of Religion named Dr. Christianson,
a studious man who taught at a small college in the Western United
States. Dr. Christianson taught the required survey course in
Christianity at this particular institution. Every student was
required to take this course his or her freshman year regardless of
his or her major. Although Dr. Christianson tried hard to communicate
the essence of the gospel in his class, he found that most of his
students looked upon the course as nothing but required drudgery.
Despite his best efforts, most students refused to take Christianity
seriously. This year, Dr. Christianson had a special student named
Steve. Steve was only a freshman, but was studying with the intent of
going into seminary for the ministry. Steve was popular, he was well
liked, and he was an imposing physical specimen. He was now the
starting center on the school football team, and was the best student
in the professor's class.</p>

<p>One day, Dr. Christianson asked Steve to stay after class so he
could talk with him. "How many push-ups can you do?" Steve said, "I
do about 200 every night." "200? That's pretty good, Steve," Dr.
Christianson said.</p>

<p>"Do you think you could do 300?" Steve replied, "I don't know...
I've never done 300 at a time." "Do you think you could?" again asked
Dr. Christianson. "Well, I can try," said Steve. "Can you do 300 in
sets of 10? I have a class project in mind and I need you to do about
300 push-ups in sets of ten for this to work. Can you do it? I need
you to tell me you can do it," said the professor. Steve said,
"Well... I think I can..! Yeah, I can do it."</p>

<p>Dr. Christianson said, "Good! I need you to do this on Friday. Let
me explain what I have in mind."</p>

<p>Friday came and Steve got to class early and sat in the front of
the room. When class started, the professor pulled out a big box of
donuts. No, these weren't the normal kinds of donuts, they were the
extra fancy BIG kind, with cream centers and frosting swirls.
Everyone was pretty excited it was Friday, the last class of the day,
and they were going to get an early start on the weekend with a party
in Dr. Christianson's class.</p>

<p>Dr. Christianson went to the first girl in the first row and
asked, "Cynthia, do you want to have one of these donuts?" Cynthia
said, "Yes." Dr. Christianson then turned to Steve and asked, "Steve,
would you do ten push-ups so that Cynthia can have a donut?" "Sure."
Steve jumped down from his desk to do a quick ten. Then Steve again
sat in his desk. Dr. Christianson put a donut on Cynthia's desk.</p>

<p>Dr. Christianson then went to Joe, the next person, and asked,
"Joe, do you want a donut?" Joe said, "Yes." Dr. Christianson asked,
"Steve would you do ten push-ups so Joe can have a donut?" Steve did
ten push-ups, Joe got a donut. And so it went, down the first aisle,
Steve did ten pushups for every person before they got their donut.
And down the second aisle, till Dr. Christianson came to Scott.</p>

<p>Scott was on the basketball team, and in as good condition as
Steve. He was very popular and never lacking for female
companionship. When the professor asked, "Scott do you want a donut?"
Scott's reply was, "Well, can I do my own pushups?" Dr. Christianson
said, "No, Steve has to do them." Then Scott said, "Well, I don't
want one then."</p>

<p>Dr. Christianson shrugged and then turned to Steve and asked,
"Steve, would you do ten pushups so Scott can have a donut he doesn't
want?" With perfect obedience Steve started to do ten pushups. Scott
said, "HEY! I said I didn't want one!"</p>

<p>Dr. Christianson said, "Look, this is my classroom, my class, my
desks, and these are my donuts. Just leave it on the desk if you
don't want it." And he put a donut on Scott's desk.</p>

<p>Now by this time, Steve had begun to slow down a little. He just
stayed on the floor between sets because it took too much effort to
be getting up and down. You could start to see a little perspiration
coming out around his brow. Dr. Christianson started down the third
row. Now the students were beginning to get a little angry.</p>

<p>Dr. Christianson asked Jenny, "Jenny, do you want a donut?"
Sternly, Jenny said, "No." Then Dr. Christianson asked Steve, "!
Steve, would you do ten more Push-ups so Jenny can have a donut that
she doesn't want?" Steve did ten.... Jenny got a donut.</p>

<p>By now, a growing sense of uneasiness filled the room. The
students were beginning to say "No" and there were all these uneaten
donuts on the desks.</p>

<p>Steve also had to really put forth a lot of extra effort to get
these pushups done for each donut. There began to be a small pool of
sweat on the floor beneath his face, his arms and brow were beginning
to get red because of the physical effort involved.</p>

<p>Dr. Christianson asked Robert, who was the most vocal unbeliever
in the class, to watch Steve do each push up to make sure he did the
full ten pushups in a set because he couldn't bear to watch all of
Steve's work for all of those uneaten donuts. He sent Robert over to
where Steve was so Robert could count the set and watch Steve
closely. Dr. Christianson started down the fourth row.</p>

<p>During his class, however, some students from other classes had
wandered in and sat down on the steps along the radiators that ran
down the sides of the room. When the professor realized this, he did
a quick count and saw that now there were 34 students in the room. He
started to worry if Steve would be able to make it. Dr. Christianson
went on to the next person and the next and the next. Near the end of
that row, Steve was really having a rough time. He was taking a lot
more time to complete each set.</p>

<p>Steve asked Dr. Christianson, "Do I have to make my nose touch on
each one?" Dr. Christianson thought for a moment, "Well, they're your
pushups. You are in charge now. You can do them any way that you
want." And Dr. Christianson went on.</p>

<p>A few moments later, Jason, a recent transfer student, came to the
room and was about to come in when all the students yelled in one
voice, "NO! Don't come in! Stay out!" Jason didn't know what was
going on.</p>

<p>Steve picked up his head and said, "No, let him come in."</p>

<p>Professor Christianson said, "You realize that if Jason comes in
you will have to do ten pushups for him?"</p>

<p>Steve said, "Yes, let him come in. Give him a donut"</p>

<p>Dr. Christianson said, "Okay, Steve, I'll let you get Jason's out
of the way right now. Jason, do you want a donut?"</p>

<p>Jason, new to the room hardly knew what was going on. "Yes," he
said, "give me a donut." "Steve, will you do ten push-ups so that
Jason can have a donut?" Steve did ten pushups very slowly and with
great effort. Jason, bewildered, was handed a donut and sat down.</p>

<p>Dr. Christianson finished the fourth row, then started on those
visitors seated by the heaters. Steve's arms were now shaking with
each push-up in a struggle to lift himself against the force of
gravity. Sweat was profusely dropping off of his face and, by this
time, there was no sound except his heavy breathing. There was not a
dry eye in the room.</p>

<p>The very last two students in the room were two young women, both
cheerleaders, and very popular. Dr. Christianson went to Linda, the
second to last, and asked, "Linda, do you want a doughnut?"</p>

<p>Linda said, very sadly, "No, thank you." Professor Christianson
quietly asked, "Steve, would you do ten push-ups so that Linda can
have a donut she doesn't want?" Grunting from the effort, Steve did
ten very slow pushups for Linda.</p>

<p>Then Dr. Christianson turned to the last girl, Susan. "Susan, do
you want a donut?" Susan, with tears already flowing down her face,
began to weep audibly. "Dr. Christianson, why can't I help him?"</p>

<p>Dr. Christianson, with tears of his own, said, "No, Steve has to
do it alone, I have given him this task and he is in charge of seeing
that everyone has an opportunity for a donut whether they want it or
not. When I decided to have a party this last day of class, I looked
at my grade book. Steve, here is the only student with a perfect
grade. Everyone else has failed a test, skipped class, or offered me
inferior work. Steve told me that in football practice, when a player
messes up he must do push-ups. I told Steve that none of you could
come to my party unless he paid the price by doing your push ups. He
and I made a deal for your sakes. Steve, would you do ten push-ups so
Susan can have a donut?" As Steve very slowly finished his last
pushup, with the understanding that he had accomplished all that was
required of him, having done 350 pushups, his arms buckled beneath
him and he fell to the floor.</p>

<p>Dr. Christianson turned to the room and said. "And so it was, that
our Savior, Jesus Christ, on the cross, cried out to the Father,
'into thy hands I commend my spirit.' With the understanding that He
had done everything that was required of Him, he yielded up His life.
And like some of those in this room, many of us leave the gift on the
desk, un-eaten." Two students helped Steve up off the floor and to a
seat, physically exhausted, but wearing a thin smile. "Well done,
good and faithful servant," said the professor, adding "Not all
sermons are preached in words."</p>

<p>Turning to his class the professor said, "My wish is that you
might understand and fully comprehend all the riches of grace and
mercy that have been given to you through the sacrifice of our Lord
and Savior Jesus Christ. He spared not only His Begotten Son, but
gave Him up for us all for the whole world now and forever. Whether
or not we choose to accept His gift to us, the price has been paid.
Wouldn't you be foolish and ungrateful to leave it laying on the
desk?"</p>
