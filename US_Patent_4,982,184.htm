<br><center><b>Abstract</b></center>
<p>A display changes the color of reflected light in response to the value of
     electrical potential applied to individual pixels of the display. Each
     pixel includes an array of light reflectors mounted on a corresponding
     array of electrostrictive elements. In the absence of energization, all
     the light reflector lie on a common plane and reflect light of all colors.
     The electrostrictive elements of each pixel in one embodiment are
     connected to be driven in common by a single potential. Each
     electrostrictive element of the array of each pixel has an effective
     length which differs from that of the adjoining elements so that the
     common voltage results in a differential expansion or contraction. The
     differential movement results in a separation between adjacent reflectors.
     When the separation is .lambda./4 at the wavelength of a color of light,
     destructive interference cancels that color, whereby physiological effects
     change the apparent color of the reflected light. In a second embodiment,
     the voltages applied to adjacent electrostructive elements differ.

<br><br>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<br><br>This invention relates to elements which reflect different colors in
     response to applied voltage, and to displays formed from arrays of such
     elements.
<br><br>Information displays have taken on a great deal of importance for conveying
     information. For example, television receivers include a kinescope, which
     is adapted for producing an internally illuminated color display of
     images. The television monitor for displaying text and graphics for
     interaction with computers has become ubiquitous. Such internally lit
     displays tend to consume substantial power. Consequently, for some
     applications reflective displays have become common. For example,
     battery-operated portable instruments, including digital watches, use
     liquid crystal displays which operate by reflecting light. For some
     purposes, liquid crystal displays may not provide sufficient reflection.
     Also, the production of color displays by use of liquid crystals does not,
     at the current state of the art, produce intense colors.
<br><br>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<br><br>A device for controlling the color of light reflected in response to
     illumination by a polychromatic source of light includes a reference
     reflective surface facing the source of light. The reflective surface has
     first and second dimensions transverse to a line joining the source of
     light and the reference reflective surface. At least the first dimension
     is on the order of a wavelength of visible light. The device also includes
     an electrostrictive element including a second reflective surface having
     first and second dimensions. The first dimension of the second reflective
     surface is also on the order of a wavelength of visible light. The second
     reflective surface is located contiguous with the reference reflective
     surface. The electrostrictive element includes first and second electrodes
     which are adapted for receiving an electrical potential. The location and
     spacing of the first and second electrodes on the electrostrictive element
     are selected in conjunction with the available electrical potential for
     causing the reflective surface to move in response to the potential in a
     direction having at least a component lying along the line which joins the
     source of light with the second reflective surface. The application of
     potential to the electrodes of the electrostrictive element causes motion
     of the second reflective surface relative to the reference reflective
     surface which results in a separation of the two reflective surfaces by
     approximately one-quarter wavelength at a frequency within the visible
     range. The quarter-wavelength separation causes destructive interference
     of a component of the polychromatic light, which results in reflection of
     a selected color of light. In a particular embodiment of the invention,
     the reference reflective surface is also mounted upon an electrostrictive
     element.

     electrostrictive elements are similarly dimensioned and the applied
     voltages differ from one to the next.
<br><br>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<br><br>FIG. 1 is a representation of a single electrostrictive element in the form
     of a dielectric electrostrictive block 10 of approximately rectangular
     shape having an upper surface 12 and a lower surface 14 which is not
     visible in FIG. 1. In this context, the term electrostrictive relates to
     objects which change size or morphology in response to applied electric
     potential. Upper surface 12 of electrostrictive block 10 has deposited
     thereon, as by vapor deposition, an electrode including a thin layer 16 of
     a conductive material such as silver. Similarly, lower surface 14 has
     deposited thereon a corresponding metallic layer 18. Layers 16 and 18 act
     as electrodes to which wires such as 20 and 22 may be connected for
     application of voltage to electrostrictive element 10. Application of a
     direct voltage to electrostrictive element 10 causes, as known, a change
     in the shape or morphology of block 10. In particular, application of
     voltage can increase or decrease the distance between the upper surface 12
     and lower surface 14 of block 10, and correspondingly between metallized
     layers 16 and 18 deposited thereon.
<br><br>FIG. 2 illustrates in perspective or isometric view an array of
     electrostrictive elements 30, 32, 34, 36 and 38, each having a separation
     between end metallizations such as 40, 50 which differs from that of the
     adjacent element, as for example, 42, 52. Electrostrictive elements 30
     through 38 are mounted on a stepped support, illustrated as 60, which is
     made from a dielectric material. The dimensions of the steps of support 60
     are selected in conjunction with the dimensions between top and bottom
     faces of electrostrictive elements 30 through 38 so that the upper end
     faces of the electrostrictive blocks lie essentially in a plane defined by
     an x axis 62 and a y axis 64. It should be noted that the thickness of
     metallization layers such as 16 and 18 of FIG. 1 and corresponding
     metallizations 40-48 (the hyphen represents the word "through", indicating
     all the described elements lying within the numbered sequence) and 50-58
     of FIG. 2 are illustrated as being proportionately thicker than the actual
     metallization would be. Thus, the upper and lower faces of
     electrostrictive elements 30 through 38 and the upper and lower surfaces
     of the associated metallizations lie essentially in the x-y plane
     illustrated in FIG. 2 when the electrostrictive elements are deenergized.
<br><br>It should be noted that while only five electrostrictive elements have been
     illustrated in FIG. 2, many more may be used. A preferred embodiment
     includes about 250 electrostrictive elements in a length L of about 1/300
     inch (84.mu.). The dimensions of the elements are further described below.
<br><br>In FIG. 2, a light source illustrated as a light bulb 70 is mounted above
     the upper faces of electrostrictive elements 30 through 38. In practice,
     the actual distance of light source 70 from the upper faces of elements 30
     through 38 is great enough so that the distance from source 70 to all of
     the elements is essentially the same, i.e., light source 70 may be
     considered to be a sufficiently great distance from elements 30 through 38
     so that a wavefront of light is essentially planar across any two adjacent
     electrostrictive elements. At least the upper faces of electrostrictive
     elements 30 through 38 are inherently light-reflective or are made to be
     light-reflective. The inherent reflectivity may arise due to a relatively
     high coefficient of refraction of the electrostrictive material, or due to
     the reflectivity of the metallizations 40 through 48, or a combination of
     both. With elements 30 through 38 deenergized and the upper faces lying
     essentially in the x-y plane, light arriving from light source 70 is
     reflected. If the light is polychromatic, all the several wavelengths
     contained therein are reflected substantially unaffected, and if source 70
     produces white light, white light will be reflected.
<br><br>Also illustrated in FIG. 2 is a voltage source 72 for producing a direct
     voltage on a first bus 74 relative to a second bus 76. Bus 74 is connected
     to upper metallizations 40, 42, 44, 46 and 48 of electrostrictive elements
     30, 32, 34, 36 and 38, respectively. Similarly, bus 76 is connected to
     lower metallizations 50, 52, 54, 56 and 58 of electrostrictive elements
     30, 32, 34, 36 and 38, respectively. When voltage source 72 is so
     connected, electrostrictive elements 30 through 38 each expand or
     contract, depending upon the polarity of applied voltage, by an amount
     which is proportional to the length of the electrostrictive element as
     measured between the electrodes its upper and lower faces. Thus,
     application of the same voltage to all of the electrostrictive elements in
     the array of FIG. 2 results in expansion or contraction of all the
     electrostrictive elements in a direction which depends upon the polarity
     of the voltage, the location of the electrodes and upon the orientation of
     the axes of the structure if the material is crystalline. The expansion or
     contraction will be differential because of the differing lengths of the
     various electrostrictive elements.
<br><br>Assuming that the polarity of the applied voltage is such as to cause
     expansion of the associated electrostrictive element in a vertical
     direction, corresponding to a direction in line with a line extending from
     light source 70 to the upper surface of the array of elements illustrated
     in FIG. 2, the upper surface will be distorted in a manner illustrated in
     more detail in FIG. 3. In FIG. 3, elements corresponding to those of FIG.
     2 are designated by the same reference numeral. In FIG. 3, the width of
     each of electrostrictive element 30, 32, 34 . . . is illustrated as W. In
     order to be reflective, dimension W must be a significant fraction of a
     wavelength of visible light, and is preferably approximately equal to one
     wavelength in the center of the visible light spectrum, or about 0.5.mu.
     (microns), corresponding to 0.5E-06 meters. Also as illustrated in FIG. 3,
     light represented by photon symbols 80 impinges upon the structure from
     the top. As mentioned, the energization of electrostrictive elements 40,
     42, . . . results in a differential motion which causes the planes of the
     reflective upper surfaces to be displaced. The displacement is
     proportional to the separation between the energizing electrodes. The
     separation between the upper reflective faces of electrostrictive elements
     30 and 32 is illustrated a S. The separation between the upper reflective
     faces of electrostrictive elements 32 and 34 is also illustrated as S. The
     dimensions of the electrostrictive elements between their respective
     electrode pairs is selected in conjunction with the range of energization
     voltages so that the value of S lies in a range extending from 0.19 to
     0.38 microns, corresponding to one-quarter wavelength (.lambda./4) within
     the visible light region. When the magnitude of S lies within this range,
     illumination by photons 80, representing white light, results in
     reflection of photons which are mutually out-of-phase at the wavelength
     corresponding to the color for which S is one-quarter wavelength.
<br><br>This out-of-phase condition results from the additional path length through
     which light must travel to be reflected from one surface by comparison
     with the path length required for reflection from the next adjacent
     surface. For example, taking the light 80 reflected from the upper surface
     of electrostrictive element 30 as a reference, light reflecting from the
     upper surface of adjacent element 32 travels an additional path length of
     .lambda./4 to reach element 32, and a further .lambda./4 to return to the
     same level as the upper surface of element 30, for a total path length
     difference of .lambda./2, or 180.degree. of phase. The mutually out-phase
     condition of the light reflected from adjacent reflective surfaces results
     in destructive interference or cancellation of light of that color.
<br><br>The destructive interference of light of a particular color caused by
     application of voltage to the structure of FIG. 2 causes a physiological
     effect which is perceived as a change in color. This phenomenon is well
     known and is used, for example, in the mixing of paints, which is a color
     subtractive process.
<br><br>FIG. 4 illustrates a plot of a visible light spectrum with wavelengths
     extending from 0.38.mu. to 0.77.mu.. White light would have equal energy
     at all wavelengths, illustrated by dot-dash line 104 having a normalized
     value of 1 measured along the ordinate. In FIG. 4, solid-line plot 100 has
     unity value at 0.38 microns and at 0.77 microns, and dips to a null
     representing substantial cancellation of reflected light at a wavelength
     near 0.58 microns, which corresponds to the color green. Plot 100
     represents the result of attenuation of white light incident upon a
     structure such as that of FIG. 2 when the magnitude S illustrated in FIG.
     3 is about 0.13 microns, which is .lambda./4 within the green light range.
     Plot 100, therefore, represents white light from which a substantial green
     component has been eliminated, which provides a physiological sensation of
     a violet color.
<br><br>Dashed-line plot 102 of FIG. 4 represents the structure of FIG. 2 at a
     greater magnitude of applied voltage, such that the separation S of FIG. 3
     is approximately 0.19 microns. A value of S of 0.19 microns corresponds to
     .lambda./4 at 0.77 micron wavelength, at which light has a red color.
     Consequently, the reflected light will have the red component
     destructively cancelled. The absence of a red component causes a
     physiological sensation of a green or aqua color. Similarly, at a lesser
     voltage such that cancellation or destructive interference of the light
     occurs at 0.38 microns, blues or violets would be cancelled from the
     reflected light, which would provide a yellow physiological sensation.
<br><br>FIG. 5 is a simplified cross-sectional elevation view of display made up of
     a plurality of arrays such as the array of FIG. 2. As illustrated in FIG.
     5, a support element 106 formed from a dielectric material provides a
     repeating sequence of five steps. As mentioned, a preferred embodiment
     provides about 250 steps in each recurrence of the sequence. Each
     recurrence of the sequence corresponds to one pixel (picture element) of
     the display. The height of the steps is selected in conjunction with the
     height of the associated electrostrictive element so that in the
     nonenergized state the reflective upper end facets or faces of all the
     electrostrictive elements lie in the xy plane. As in the arrangement of
     FIG. 2, all the elements of one array of steps are connected electrically
     in parallel. Thus, elements 30, 32, 34, 36 and 38 of FIG. 5 have their
     upper electrodes (not separately designated) connected in common to a bus
     74, and their lower metallizations connected in common to a bus 76. The
     adjacent set of elements including elements 30', 32', 34', 36', and 38'
     have their upper electrodes connected in common to a bus 74' which is not
     connected to bus 74. However, elements 30'-38' have their lower electrodes
     or metallizations connected to common bus 76. Similarly, electrostrictive
     elements 30", 32", 34", 36" . . . have their upper electrodes connected in
     common to a bus 74"which is not connected to either bus 74 or to bus 74'.
     The lower electrodes of electrostrictive elements 30"-36" . . . are
     connected to common bus 76. With the described arrangement, a different
     voltage may be applied to electrostrictive elements 30-38 by comparison
     with the voltage applied to elements 30'-38' or to 30"-36", so that
     different colors may be reflected by different pixels or portions of the
     display.
<br><br>FIG. 6a illustrates in simplified form a two-dimensional display 120
     consisting of rows and columns, each element of which is an arrangement
     similar to that of FIG. 2, and each row of which is an array similar to
     that illustrated in FIG. 5. As described in conjunction with FIG. 5, each
     pixel of the display 120 of FIG. 6a is associated with its own individual
     bus such as 74, 74', 74" etc. As illustrated in FIG. 6a, display 120
     includes six rows and six columns, and therefore, includes 36 elements
     similar to the arrangement of FIG. 2. Consequently, there are 36
     independent buses which are illustrated as collected into a bundle 122. In
     addition to bundle 122, one or more common conductors 76 complete the
     connections. Each bus 74, 74', 74" . . . of conductor bundle 122 is
     connected to one electrode of a capacitor of a capacitor bank 124. A few
     of the capacitors 75, 75', 75" of capacitor bank 124 are illustrated in
     FIG. 6b. As illustrated therein, each capacitor is grounded, and the
     ground is connected to common conductor 76. Each capacitor of capacitor
     bank 124 periodically receives an analog voltage from a multiplexer 126 by
     way of a multiconductor bus 128. Multiplexer 126 in practice is an array
     of semiconductor transmission gates, but for simplicity may be represented
     as a single-pole, 36-throw mechanical switch, as suggested by switch 127
     of FIG. 6b.
<br><br>The capacitors of capacitor bank 124 are dimensioned in conjunction with
     the resistance of the electrostrictive elements with which they are
     associated so that the analog voltage does not decrease significantly
     during the interval between refreshes from multiplexer 126. Multiplexer
     126 receives its input from a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 130, which
     in turn receives a sequence of digital words representative of analog
     voltages over a conductor set 132 from a preprogrammed memory 134. The
     memory locations of memory 134 are addressed in sequence by an address
     control arrangement illustrated as a block 136, which produces a recurrent
     sequence of addresses which recurrently steps through all programmed
     memory locations. For the arrangement illustrated in FIG. 6a, address
     control 136 produces a recurrent sequence of 36 addresses which accesses
     36 separate memory locations of memory 134, one for each pixel of display
     120. Simultaneously, the addresses produced by control 136 are applied to
     multiplexer 126 for uniquely associating the output signal from each
     memory location of memory 134 with a capacitor of capacitor bank 124.
     Consequently, as memory 134 is addressed in sequence to produce digital
     words representative of analog voltages, DAC 130 converts the digital
     words into analog voltages, which are applied by multiplexer 126 to one of
     the 36 capacitors of capacitor bank 124. The various memory locations of
     memory 134 are preprogrammed with digital words representing voltages
     which, when applied to the pixels of dispaly 120, produce desired patterns
     of colors. With this arrangement, a predetermined pattern of colors may be
     produced by light reflected from the surface of display 120. As
     illustrated in FIG. 6a certain of the pixels are shaded and marked with a
     Y to indicate that they are receiving voltage selected to provide a yellow
     reflected color, whereas the unshaded elements receive an analog voltage
     selected to provide a violet reflected color. As illustrated in FIG. 6a,
     the displayed pattern represents the numeral 2.
<br><br>As so far described, memory 134 is preprogrammed with digital words which
     result in a display of a single numeral. As known, memory 134 may be a RAM
     which is loaded on a frame-by-frame basis to produce any desired pattern
     of colors on display 120.
<br><br>FIG. 7 illustrates in simplified elevation view a portion of the structure
     of FIG. 2. In FIG. 7, common connections of the top electrodes 42, 44 and
     46, among each other, and to bus 74 are provided by beads 140 of
     electrically conductive room-temperature vulcanizing (RTV) elastomer which
     bridge across the gaps (if any) between the elements or between the
     electrodes thereof. The elastomer not only provides electrical contact but
     aids in retaining the electrostrictive elements in their proper position.
     Similarly, additional beads 142 of RTV connect the lower electrodes such
     as 52, 54, 56 together and to bus conductor 76. Suitable elastomers are
     type CV2640graphite-filled or CV1500 carbon-filled RTV, both manufactured
     by McGhan Nusil Company of California.
<br><br>In FIG. 8, six electrostrictive elements 830, 832, 834, 836, 838 and 840
     have the same height and are mounted upon a flat base 860. The upper
     surface 862 of base 860 is metallized for electrical conduction. The lower
     surfaces (not illustrated) of elements 830-840 are in electrical contact
     with metallization 862. A controllable source 872 of proportional voltages
     includes a controllable source of direct voltage 874 illustrated by a
     battery symbol which is transfixed by an arrow. A resistive voltage
     divider 876 is connected across source 874. The negative terminal of
     source 874 is connected to metallized surface 862 of base 860. A voltage
     appears at each node of voltage divider 876 relative to metallization 862
     which is a fixed proportion of the voltage of source 874. The proportion
     depends, as known, upon the values of the resistors of voltage divider
     876. Light-reflective electrodes (not illustrated) associated with the
     upper surfaces of electrostrictive elements 830-840 are individually
     connected to the various nodes of voltage divider 876 in such a fashion
     that each electrostrictive element receives a voltage which is different
     from that of adjacent elements. Each electrostrictive element, therefore,
     expands or contracts by a different amount than the adjacent elements,
     thereby establishing the physical separation which results in selective
     cancellation of particular wavelengths.
<br><br>Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the
     art. For example, electrostrictive materials other than crystalline quartz
     may be used, such as rochelle salts. While a source of white light has
     been described, any source of polychromatic light may be used, although
     the range of resulting reflected colors may be limited. If a source of
     monochromatic light is used, as for example a laser, a change in color
     will not occur, but the display will go from a reflective condition to a
     nonreflective condition when the spacing S between reflective ends is
     .lambda./4 at the monochromatic wavelength. Also, while visible light has
     been described, the same kind of function may be provided for invisible
     radiation such as infrared or ultraviolet. As described, the distance S
     between the reflective ends of the electrostrictive elements is equal for
     all the electrostrictive elements of one pixel, as for example elements
     30-38 of FIG. 5, but it may be desirable to provide a slight difference in
     spacing to tend to cancel a broader range of wavelength related to the
     color being subtracted from the incident light.
