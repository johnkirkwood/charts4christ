   Church of the Holy Sepulcher was largely destroyed by Caliph
   al-Hakim in 1009, and partially restored in 1048, during the reign
   of the Byzantine  Emperor Monomachus. The Crusaders decided to
   renovate the building completely. Wilhelm of Tyre relates: "Before
   the coming of the Crusaders, the place where Jesus suffered at
   Golgotha, the place where the cross was reputedly discovered, and
   the place where Jesus' body was interred for burial - these places
   were small chapels outside the church. However, after they had
   conquered the city the Crusaders found the church too small, and
   they added to it a sturdy, high building in which the places
   mentioned were concentrated under one roof. A bell tower was also
   built. The rebuilt church was consecrated by the Crusader Queen
   Melisanda, the daughter of Baldwin II, in 1149, the jubilee
   anniversary of the  city's conquest.</font></dd>

   church preserves the Crusader structure. The impressive stone
   decorations that adorn the facade also date from Crusader
   times.</font></dd>
