<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#0000CC"><i>Old man seated asleep on his cane.
Nowhere in particular yet anywhere in general. Voice from elsewhere
speaks.</i></font></p>

<p>Voice- <font color="#0000CC"><i>Firmly at first, always with love
but with progressing tenderness,</i></font> "Awake thou that sleepest
and arise from the dead and Christ shall shine upon you."
<font color="#990066">[Eph. 5:14]</font> "Awake and sing, ye
that dwell in the dust; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs and the
earth shall cast forth the dead."
<font color="#990066">[Isa.26:19]</font></p>

<p>Just Resurrected One- <font color="#0000CC"><i>Wakes, straightens
up just a little in his chair still leaning on his cane.
Plaintively,</i></font> "Aaaangh!.... Sing?... I can just barely sit
up!"</p>

<p>Voice- "Arise and shine for thy light is come and the glory of
Jehovah is risen upon thee." <font color="#990066">[Isa.
60:1]</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>Continues to lean heavily on the
cane, Irritably,</i> </font>"OK already, I'm up, but I must still be
dreaming because this surely isn't the place where I went to sleep.
How did I get here anyway?"</p>

<p>Voice- "Have you not read that which was spoken unto you by God,
as to the resurrection of the dead? I am the God of Abraham and the
God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. God is not of the dead but of the
living." <font color="#990066">[Mat. 22:31]</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>Somewhat irritably,</i>
</font>"Yes, that does sound familiar, but what does that have to do
with me."</p>

<p>Voice- "So then as through one trespass unto all men came
condemnation; even so through one act of righteousness unto all men
came justification of life." <font color="#990066">[Rom.
5:18]</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>With a hint of derision,</i>
</font>"Nice, however you cant mean ALL people can you? I know I'm
quite a ways down the list... but, really... EVERYBODY?"</p>

<p>Voice- "Marvel not at this: For the hour cometh in which ALL that
are in the tombs shall hear His Voice- and shall come forth; they
that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that
have done evil unto the resurrection of judgment."
<font color="#990066">[John 5:28]</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>Resignedly,</i></font> "Oh yeah, I
remember the judgment part. That must be for me...</p>

<p><font color="#0000CC"><i>Hope dawns, but just barely,</i></font>
"Hmmmm ....This doesn't look like a courtroom and I don't see a
judge.... What is this judgment thing anyway?"</p>

<p>Voice- "Jehovah sitteth forever. He has prepared His throne for
judgment; and He will judge the world in righteousness, He will
minister judgment to the people in uprightness. Jehovah will also be
a high tower for the oppressed, a high tower in times of trouble; and
they that know his name will put their trust in Him; for Jehovah has
not forsaken them that seek Him. <font color="#990066">[Ps.
9:7]</font> Good and upright is Jehovah: Therefore He will
instruct sinners in the way. The meek will He guide in judgment and
the meek will he teach His way. All the paths of Jehovah are loving
kindness and truth to those who keep His covenant and His
testimonies." <font color="#990066">[Ps. 25:8]</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>Brightens some,</i></font>
"Instruct sinners...... and guide the meek.... That doesn't sound so
bad. Tell me more."</p>

<p>Voice- "Thus saith God Jehovah, He that created the heavens and
stretched them forth; He that spread abroad the earth and that which
cometh out of it; He that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and
spirit to them that walk therein: I, Jehovah, have called thee in
righteousness, and will hold thy hand and will keep thee, and give
thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the gentiles; to
open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, and
them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house."
<font color="#990066">[Isa. 42:5]</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>With some
derision</i></font><font color="#000000"><i>,</i></font> "Wonderful,
but how long does it last?"</p>

<p>Voice- "Verily, verily, I say unto you , he that heareth my word
and believeth him that sent me hath eternal life and cometh not into
condemnation, but passes out of death into life."
<font color="#990066">[John 5:24]</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>With some derision, say</i></font>
"Passes out of death unto eternal life? That sounds very nice but
what about sin and the fall and the curse and all that?"</p>

<p>Voice- "Come now, let us reason together, saith Jehovah: though
your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they
be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. If ye be willing and
obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:" ...
<font color="#990066">[Isa. 1:18]</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>With signs of real
curiosity,</i></font> "Sins! yes! I have plenty of them. Tell me,
though, how can they possibly be made as white as snow?"</p>

<p>Voice- "Behold the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will make a
new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of judah: I
will put my law in their inward parts and in their heart will I write
it; and I will be their God and they will be my people. And they will
teach no more, every man his neighbor and every man his brother,
saying, know Jehovah, for they shall all know me from the least of
them to the greatest of them, saith Jehovah: for I will forgive their
iniquity and their sin will I remember no more."
<font color="#990066">[Jer. 31:31]</font></p>

<p>Just- "I feel better already. Hmmmmm... Is it OK if I am not a
Jew?..."</p>

<p>Voice- "This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our
saviour; who would have ALL men to be saved and come to the knowledge
of the truth. For there is one God, one mediator also between God and
men, himself man, Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all
men." <font color="#990066">[1 Tim. 2:3]</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>Beginning to relax,</i></font>
"Jesus Christ the great mediator between God and man... That is a new
idea to me. How did it begin that one in such a high position as THE
WORD, I believe that was his name in Heaven, came to be the mediator
for all mankind?"</p>

<p>Voice- "God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten son,
so that whosoever may believe on him should not perish, but have
eternal life. God sent not the Son into the world to condemn the
world but that the world should be saved through
him."<font color="#990066">[John 3:16]</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>Curiously,</i></font> "The WORD,
the son of God, became a baby human?"</p>

<p>Voice- "The WORD became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his
glory, glory as of the only begotten of the father, full of grace and
truth." <font color="#990066">[John 1:14]</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>With some hope but not
much,</i></font> "I see. He became flesh like me. Doesn't seem,
though, that becoming a man would do a whole lot of good."</p>

<p>Voice- "Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made
alive." <font color="#990066">[1 Cor. 15:21]</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>Prankishly,</i></font> "Pretty good
trick for a dead man, don't you think? He did die didn't he?"</p>

<p>Voice- "The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew,
hanging him on a tree. Him did God exalt with His right hand to be a
prince and saviour, to give reformation to Israel, and forgiveness of
sins." <font color="#990066">[Acts 5:30]</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>Prankishly,</i></font> "Raised him
up to be a "prince and savior" for what?"</p>

<p>Voice- "The government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name
shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, mighty God, Everlasting
Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and of
peace, there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his
kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with
righteousness from henceforth even for ever."
<font color="#990066">[Is. 9: 6-7].</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>Brightens with understanding and
concern,</i></font> "This plan is all well and good on the face of
it, but how are you ever going to get it past city hall? Or those
hard headed fellows that run the nation, how are you going to get
them out of the way?"</p>

<p>Voice- "Behold, Jehovah, like a strong man, will hurl thee away
violently; yea, he will wrap thee up closely. He will surely wind
thee round and round, and toss thee like a ball into a large country;
there shalt thou die, and there shall be the chariots of thy glory,
thou shame of thy Lord's house. And I will thrust thee from thine
office; and from thy station shalt thou be pulled down."
<font color="#990066">[Is. 22: 17-19]</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>Curiously thoughtful,</i></font>
"Hmmmmm... Out of office... Without a station.... Pulled down like an
old barn ... Sounds rather chaotic."</p>

<p>Voice- "Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the
former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. But be ye
glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create; for, behold, I
create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. And I will
rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and there shall be heard
in her no more the Voice- of weeping and the Voice- of crying. ...
And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant
vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build, and
another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat: for as the
days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall
long enjoy the work of their hands. They shall not labor in vain, nor
bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed
Jehovah, and their offspring with them. And it shall come to pass
that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet
speaking, I will hear. The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and
the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's
food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith
Jehovah. Thus saith Jehovah, heaven is my throne, and the earth is my
footstool." <font color="#990066">[Is 65:17-66:1]</font>.</p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>With growing interest and true
concern,</i></font> "I heard about that lion and lamb part before I
died and I wondered a lot how law and order would be kept in all that
peacefulness."</p>

<p>Voice- ... "he that overcometh, and he that keepeth my works unto
the end, to him will I give authority over the nations: and he shall
rule them with a rod of iron," ... <font color="#990066">[Rev. 2:
26-27]</font>.</p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>With growing interest and true
concern,</i></font> "If I could see into heaven, could I see these
that overcome and are given authority?"</p>

<p>Voice- "Behold, the Lamb standing on the mount Zion and with him a
hundred and forty and four thousand ... they that had been purchased
out of the earth. ... These are they that follow the Lamb wherever he
goes. These were purchased from among men to be the first fruits unto
God and unto the Lamb. And in their mouth was found no lie: they are
without blemish." <font color="#990066">[Rev.
14:1]</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>With growing
self-confidence,</i></font> "Let me get this straight. We now have a
new stable and loving government, truth and goodness are the order of
the day, the rulers are working in the best interest of all, peace
reigns... Only one thing you seem to have overlooked. I heard of some
pretty unsavory things going on in the church before I died. The one
true and apostolic church they called it. Seems like they could put
quite a cramp in all this goodness. What will you say to the church,
being God's people and all."</p>

<p>Voice- "Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of
Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the
Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate...
Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I
will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a man... Sit thou
silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for
thou shalt no more be called The mistress of kingdoms."
<font color="#990066">[Is. 47:1-5]</font></p>

<p>Just- "But the organization could still make a grab for power.
What of the organization?"</p>

<p>Voice- "How much soever she glorified herself, and waxed wanton,
so much give her of torment and mourning: for she saith in her heart,
I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall in no wise see mourning.
Therefore in one day shall her plagues come, death, and mourning, and
famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire; for strong is the
Lord god who judged her." <font color="#990066">[Rev.
18:7-8].</font></p>

<p>Just- "Oooo! Sounds final, but go on."</p>

<p>Voice- "And a strong angel took up a stone, as it were a great
millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with a mighty fall
shall Babylon, the great city, be cast down, and shall be found no
more at all." <font color="#990066">[Rev. 18:21]</font>.</p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>Brightly with the feeling that this
just might work,</i></font> "The situation is looking great... but
just one last thing. What about the wily old devil himself?"</p>

<p>Voice- ... "I saw an angel coming down out of heaven having the
key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on
the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound
him for a thousand years, and cast him into the abyss, and shut it
and sealed it over him, that he should deceive the nations no more
until the thousand years should be finished:"..
<font color="#990066">[Rev. 20:1]</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>Eagerly,</i></font> "Yes.... Go
on."</p>

<p>Voice- "And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall be
loosed out of his prison and shall come forth to deceive the nations
which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather
them together to the war: the number of whom is as the sand of the
sea. And when they went up over the breadth of the earth, and
compassed the camp of the saints about and the beloved city: and fire
came down out of heaven and devoured them. And the devil that
deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are
also the beast and the false prophet." ...
<font color="#990066">[Rev. 20:7]</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>Brightly.</i></font>
<font color="#0000FF"><i>Leaning on the cane less and less and by
this time using it to gesture and demonstrate</i></font>, "That's
quite final and permanent! Lake of fire.... Hmmmmm I'd like to know
more about that but just now I'd like to ask some other questions. Is
that OK?"</p>

<p>Voice- "Ask and it shall be given (to) you."
<font color="#990066">[Mat. 7:7]</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000CC"><i>With the gathering strength of long
lost hopes well fulfilled,</i></font> "I have to admit that when I
found myself in this chair for the first time I was a bit miffed.
First that I had missed out on heaven, second, that I had been lied
to about hell, and third, that I was right back on earth with the
same old decrepit body. What you have been telling me for these few
minutes have been the best news I have ever heard. With those bright
peaceful days ahead I don't feel half so old as when I first woke up.
This new situation suits me very well and I'm beginning to like you,
(tenderly) whoever you are, very much. So tell me ... how did it all
begin?"</p>

<p>Voice- "In a beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was a God. The same was in a beginning with God. All
things were made through him; and without him was not anything made
that was made." <font color="#990066">[John
1:1-3]</font>.</p>

<p>Just- "Yes, I've wondered about the beginning of the WORD. Tell me
though, when did the Earth begin?"</p>

<p>Voice- "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And
the earth was without form and void; and darkness was on the face of
the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
And God said, let there be light: and there was light. And God saw
the light that it was good: and God divided the light from the
darkness. God called the light day, and the darkness He called night.
And the evening and morning were the first day."
<font color="#990066">[Gen. 1:1-5]</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000FF"><i>Now more alive and
animated,</i></font> "This is all very very beautiful and I feel
blessed beyond my dreams; but what do you want from me? What should I
do?"</p>

<p>Voice- "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the great and first
commandment. And a second, like unto it, is this; Thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments the whole law hangeth,
and the prophets." <font color="#990066">[Mat.
22:37]</font></p>

<p>Just- <font color="#0000FF"><i>Sincerely with great joy , stands
with the strength and stature born of great humility, conviction and
promise,</i></font> "Thank you so much for a real chance to do my
best, though its not altogether easy," .....
<font color="#0000CC"><i>With a touch of jest,</i></font> "Is there
any other way?"</p>

<p>Voice- "I am the way, and the truth, and the life: No one comes to
the father, but by me." <font color="#990066">[John
14:6]</font></p>

<p><font face="Times">Just- </font><font face="Times" color="#0000CC"><i>Very
pleased with the promise of things to come, ponders the cane for its
past help and its retirement as a crutch, hangs the cane carefully on
the back of the chair and strides purposefully off stage, smiling in
God's love.</i></font></p>
