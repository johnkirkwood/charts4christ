<p>To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to
this word it is because there is no light in them
<font color="#990066">[Isa. 8: 20]</font>.</p>

<p>Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth
not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth
<font color="#990066">[2 Tim. 2: 15]</font>.</p>

<p>Knowing this first that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private
interpretation <font color="#990066">[2 Peter 1:

<p>Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that
proceedeth out of the mouth of God <font color="#990066">[Matt.

<p>Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path

<p>To us there is but one God, the Father, of Whom are all things
<font color="#990066">[1 Cor. 8: 6]</font>, The King of kings
and Lord of lords, Who only hath immortality
<font color="#990066">[1 Tim. 6: 16]</font>, and one Lord
Jesus Christ, by Whom are all things <font color="#990066">[1
Cor. 8: 6]</font>, the beginning of the creation of God
<font color="#990066">[Rev. 3: 14]</font>.</p>

<p>God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; He judgeth among
the gods <font color="#990066">[Psa. 82: 1]</font>; for the
Lord is a great God and a great King above all gods
<font color="#990066">[Psa. 95: 3]</font>.</p>

<p>In a beginning was the Word, and the Word was with THE God: and a
god was the Word <font color="#990066">[John 1: 1
(Diaglott)]</font>, and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
us <font color="#990066">[John 1: 14]</font>. The same was in
the beginning with God. All things were made by him
<font color="#990066">[John 1: 2, 3]</font>.</p>

<p>Jesus answered them. I and my Father are One
<font color="#990066">[John 10: 25, 30]</font>.</p>

believe on Me through their word ... THAT THEY MAY BE ONE EVEN AS WE

<p>My Father is GREATER than I <font color="#990066">[John 14:
28]</font>. I proceeded forth and came from God
<font color="#990066">[John 8: 42]</font>. I seek not mine
own will, but the will of the Father. I can of mine own self do
nothing <font color="#990066">[John 5: 30]</font>.</p>

<p>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end
<font color="#990066">[Rev. 21: 6]</font>. The beginning of
the creation of God <font color="#990066">[Rev. 3:

<p>God created the Heaven and the earth
<font color="#990066">[Gen. 1: 1]</font>, by Jesus Christ
[Eph. 3: 9] that in the ages to come He might show the
exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us through Jesus
Christ <font color="#990066">[Eph. 2: 7]</font>.</p>

<p>And God said, let us make man in our image, after our likeness and
let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of
the air, and over the cattle and over all the earth
<font color="#990066">[Gen. 1: 26]</font>.</p>

<p>And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and MAN became a
living soul <font color="#990066">[Gen. 2: 7]</font>.</p>

<p>What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? ... for Thou hast made
him a little lower than the angels <font color="#990066">[Psa. 8:
4]</font>.</p>

<p>And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He
put the man whom He had formed. And out of the ground made the Lord
God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for
food; the tree of life also and the tree of knowledge of good and
evil <font color="#990066">[Gen. 2: 9]</font>.</p>

<p>And the Lord God said, it is not good that the man should be
alone, I will make him an help meet for him
<font color="#990066">[Gen. 2: 18]</font>. And The Lord God
caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam ... and the rib, which the Lord
God had taken from man, made He a woman, and brought her unto man
<font color="#990066">[Gen. 2: 21, 22].</font></p>

<p>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and they were not
ashamed <font color="#990066">[Gen. 2: 25]</font>.</p>

<p>And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, of every tree of the
garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day thou eatest
of it thou shalt surely die <font color="#990066">[Gen. 2: 16,
17].</font></p>

<p>And God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very
good <font color="#990066">[Gen. 1: 31].</font></p>

<p>and Satan <font color="#990066">[Rev. 12: 9]</font>. He
was a murderer from the beginning <font color="#990066">[John 8:

<p>Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which
the Lord God had made, and he saith unto the woman, yea, hath God
said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</p>

<p>And the woman said ... of the fruit of the tree that is in the
midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it ... lest
ye die <font color="#990066">[Gen. 3: 1,

<p>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that
it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one
wise, she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto
her husband and he did eat <font color="#990066">[Gen. 3:
4-6]</font>.</p>

<p>Adam was not deceived <font color="#990066">[1 Tim. 2:

and death by sin [Rom. 5: 12] for the wages of sin is death

<p>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one [Job
14: 4]. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a
corrupt tree bring forth good fruit <font color="#990066">[Matt.

<p>And the Lord God said unto the serpent ... I will put enmity
between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed it
shall bruise thy head <font color="#990066">[Gen. 3:
15].</font></p>

<p>And unto the woman He said ... in sorrow shalt thou bring forth
children. And unto Adam he said; cursed is the ground for thy sake
... thorns and thistles shall it bring to thee; ... in the sweat of
thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground; for
out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou
return <font color="#990066">[Gen. 3: 14, 19].</font></p>

<p>And the Lord God said, ... and now lest he take also of the tree
of life, and eat, and live forever ... therefore the Lord God sent
him forth from the Garden of Eden, ... and He placed ... Cherubims
and a flaming sword ... to keep the way of the tree of life
<font color="#990066">[Gen. 3: 22-24].</font></p>

<p>And all the days that Adam lived were 930 years, and he DIED
<font color="#990066">[Gen. 5: 5].</font> But, beloved, be

<p>For since by man came death, by man (the man Christ Jesus
<font color="#990066">[1 Tim. 2: 5]</font>) came also the
resurrection from the dead <font color="#990066">[1 Cor. 15:

also hath once suffered for sins, the Just for the unjust, that He

<p>The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the

<font color="#990066">[Heb. 3: 1]</font>), that they,

they crucify two thieves, the one on His right hand and the other on

<p>And one of the malefactors ... railed on Him, saying If thou be
Christ, save Thyself and us. But the other rebuked him, saying, ...
we receive the due reward of our deed, but this man hath done nothing
amiss. And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when Thou comest
into Thy kingdom.</p>

<p>And he said to him, Indeed I say to thee this day, thou shalt be
with me in Paradise <font color="#990066">[Luke 23: 43

<p>And when they had fulfilled all that was written of Him they took
Him down from the tree and laid Him in a sepulchre

three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so shall the Son of
man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth
<font color="#990066">[Matt. 12: 40]</font>.</p>

<p>Him God raised up the third day and showed Him openly. Not to all
the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who
did eat and drink with Him after He rose from the dead [Acts 10:
40], unto the apostles whom He had chosen ... being seen of them
forty days <font color="#990066">[Acts. 1: 2,3]</font>.</p>

<p>This same Jesus which is taken up from you into Heaven shall so
come in like manner (not to all the people

look for Him shall He appear the second time
<font color="#990066">[Heb. 9: 28]</font> as ye have seen Him
go into Heaven <font color="#990066">[Acts 1: 11]</font>.</p>

<p>Simon hath declared how God ... did visit the Gentiles to take out
of them a people for His name ... and to this agree the words of the
prophets ... After this I will return and will rebuild the tabernacle
of David which is fallen down ... that the residue of men might seek
after the Lord <font color="#990066">[Acts 15:

<p>Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles until the times of

set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed

they call Jerusalem the Throne of the Lord, and all nations shall be

<p>We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, which none of the princes

they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them because they

<p>In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed

shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the Kingdom of

<p>Though He were a Son, yet learned He obedience by the things which
He suffered <font color="#990066">[Heb. 5: 8]</font>. In the

<font color="#990066">[Isa. 53: 3]</font>. He humbled Himself

<p>Wherefore God hath highly exalted him

working of His mighty power which He wrought in Christ when He raised
Him from the dead (the first that should rise from the dead

<p>When men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters

which were disobedient in the days of Noah

daughters of man that they were fair, and they took them wives of all

<p>There were giants in those days ... the earth was corrupt and ...

every imagination of the thoughts of his heart only evil continually
<font color="#990066">[Gen. 6 : 4, 11, 5]</font>.</p>

<p>But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. Noah was a just man,

<p>God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come ... I do bring a
