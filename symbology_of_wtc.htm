<h2>What God Shall Shortly Do</h2>

<dl>
   <dt><font size="+1">I think I have to start in the present and
   work both ways on this topic. The World Trade Center destruction
   is at once sad, for the victims, relatives and all of us who are
   touched by their loss, and symbolic of what God will do before He
   will set up His kingdom. The placement in time of this very large
   milestone is precise and significant. The world over, there are
   vew people indeed who have not heard of the four planes and the
   destruction that they did. </font></dt>
