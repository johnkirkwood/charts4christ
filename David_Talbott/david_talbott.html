<p>Subject: David</p>

<p>We have been in a bit of turmoil here. David has been sick and has
become extremely weak and anemic. We found out Wednesday that he has
cancer of the esophagus. He had a cat scan today. We won't hear from
that for a week or so. Then we will know how far it has spread.</p>

<p>We don't know the prognosis or the options yet. The doctor who did
the endoscopy told us that it is cancer of the esophagus. He said
David will need surgery, but not until he has had chemo and/or
radiation therapy. We have been told of a Dr. in Seattle at UW who
specializes in esophageal cancer. My hope is that David will want to
go there.</p>

<p>We have a deep and abiding faith and accept whatever the Lord's
will be in this case. Of course, we want healing and good health.</p>

<p>The specimens taken two weeks ago when David had his endoscopy
were called "suspected malignant". The Oncologist said she could not
treat based on that and requested a repeat endoscopy for more, larger
specimens. David had that procedure this morning.</p>

<p>He had no problems and ate a big breakfast before we came home. We
should have pathology reports by Monday afternoon--maybe.</p>

<p>After that should be a return visit to the oncologist, Dr.
Pant.</p>

<p>David has a very positive attitude and that will go a long ways in
dealing with all of this which is beginning to be overwhelming.</p>

<p>If you do not want these updates, let me know and I will stop
sending them to you.</p>

<p>Hi!</p>

<p>We are still waiting for the biopsy report. I just called the
Dr.'s office and was told it usually takes 10 days and that the
doctor would call me. I told her he didn't last time and that he
should not tell patients that the report would be back in 2 days. She
said she would make sure he called us when the report comes in.</p>

<p>In the meantime, all of the iron David has been taking is turning
into red blood cells and he is getting some energy back.</p>

<p>We have had a busy week with friends and family from far and near.
Friday evening we went to the movies at our church and saw "My Great
Big Fat Greek Wedding". It was hilarious and we both had a good time.
Sunday we went to David's sister, Linda's place and there were family
from Pocatello and Alaska, and all parts between. There were 25 or so
folks there and we had a great time visiting and catching up with
each other's lives. During the week David's cousin, Roger and wife
Peggy visited with us, as did friend Diane Starr from Canada.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I joined the FlyLady (http://www.FlyLady.net) and
have been working on decluttering--in the corners David does not
frequent! It is going to be a great challange reclaiming some parts
of the house.</p>

<p>I will keep you informed and as always, if you do not want to
receive these updades, just let me know.</p>

<p>I took David to Lewiston to St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center
this morning to begin his chemo and radiation therapy. Once a
diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was confirmed by biopsy and pathology
reports, things started to move rather quickly. Dr. Pant called as
soon as she had the biopsy report and set up admission for him in
Lewiston. Dr. Pant was there this morning to admit him. She went over
what we could expect from the chemo. I asked if there were any
restriction on visitors. She said there would be not problem while he
is in the hospital. However, she said that in 1-2 weeks his immune
system would be at it's lowest and that he must be careful of what he
eats and drinks and should avoid contact with children and with
people with colds. I asked about procrit before they started chemo.
She said procrit was used in cases where the body was not producing
blood cells, not for iron deficiency anemia. David's iron deficiency
anemia comes from bleeding faster from the cancer than he can produce
red blood cells.</p>

<p>They inserted a pic-line and started working on rehydrating him.
Blood tests showed that he was even more anemic than he had been a
month ago in Moscow, in spite of ingesting iron three times a day.
Two units of blood were ordered. I commented that I had frequently
thought he was a quart low...</p>

<p>Chemo had to be postponed until the blood was infused because the
pic-line only has two access ports--one for the rehydration and one
for the blood. They had finished one unit before I left at 5:30 PM.
It was nice to see a little pink in his ears and lips.</p>

<p>The Radiologist, Dr. Anderson, met with us briefly to sort of
outline what can be expected from the radiation therapy. It appears
that David will begin to swallow better from the chemo, and then in
1-2 weeks AFTER the radiation is done he will get the world's worst
sore throat. He told us that nutrition was all important and that
David must continue to eat (drink) even though his throat is sore.
tomorrow morning the radiologists will have a set-up session where
they will be x-raying David and determining the set up for following
radiation therapy sessions. He will have some tattoos and some marks
that will wear or wash off. Dr. Anderson told us that future sessions
will only take 15 minutes.</p>

<p>David seems to be taking this all very well. He is giving the
nurses a bad time. I told them they would be telling him to "go home"
before his time was up.</p>

<p>We feel that we are buoyed up by the thoughts and prayers of
family and friends and people we don't even know. Right now, I am
giving prayers of thanks for people who donated the blood that will
help David to feel better and to withstand the rigors of the upcoming
treatments.</p>

<p>For those who are close enough to visit and feel so inclined, he
is in room 4C11. Maybe I should say cell 4C11. I have never seen such
a small room. He does have a window that looks out over the Lewiston
and Clarkston and up into the hills across the river.</p>

<p>His phone number is (208) 750-7411.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening and for caring.</p>

<p>David is still at St. Jo's. His condition deteriorated after I
spoke with him yesterday, with an increase in the nausea and coughing
up blood. He has finished the first round of chemo. They want to keep
him on a saline IV until he can eat/drink enough to stay hydrated.
They are going to give him an injection to boost his immune system.
He has had the first two radiation treatments. He has 23 to go.</p>

<p>I'll let you all know what happens tomorrow.</p>

<p>Subject: David Update 3/2/03</p>

<p>I took Jeanette down to Lewiston with me to visit David. He seemed
a little more chipper than he had been yesterday. He received 1 unit
of blood during the day and will receive a second unit tonight.</p>

<p>They are still trying to eliminate the barium from his system. Dr.
Pant is now thinking that he has diabetic neuropathy of the small
intestine and that is why things are not moving through him very
well. They are putting him on a different diet, ad lib--he can choose
whatever sounds good to him with the caveat that he can't ever eat
popcorn again or any nuts (which had been pretty high on his list of
loved foods). He was so taken aback that he didn't think to ask why
these restrictions, or he didn't remember the rationale.</p>

<p>He is wondering if the chemo did a number on his digestive system
since he wasn't having these problems before all of this medical
intervention started.</p>

<p>I looked him in the eye last night and told him he was in charge.
The doctors told us that the key to getting through all of this was
nutrition, nutrition, nutrition. I assured him that nobody was going
to force feed him. The choice was his. He nodded his head.</p>

<p>I guess the reality of all of this is finally hitting me. I have
been very weepy today for the first time. It was all set off by
writing a note of condolence to a friend who has a dog with cancer
and has opted to have it put down. It is not that easy for humans.
Cancer has stolen my mother, my brothers, aunts and uncles from both
sides of my family, my father-in-law, a dog and several cats from my
life. Now, it seems it is taking David.</p>

<p>For those who have offered to give blood for David, I understand
that there is currently no program for crediting or designating the
blood to a specific recipient. Someone has donated the blood that
David is receiving. Blood that you might donate will give someone
else a much needed boost. You can say in your heart that this is for
David, and it will be so.</p>

<p>Thanks for letting me ramble. I seem to need to do this to relieve
some of the distress that I am feeling.</p>

<p>Subject: David Update</p>

<p>Today the other shoe dropped. In the process of trying to figure
out why things don't pass through David's digestive tract, they did
an mri of his brain. The cancer has metastasized to his brain.</p>

<p>The prognosis is at best a year.</p>

<p>They will start radiation to his head tomorrow. They think that
reducing the tumors and reducing the swelling in his brain may reduce
the nausea and sense of fullness that he is experiencing. They are
giving him decadron to reduce swelling in the brain.</p>

<p>He has been told to get his affairs in order and that he should
not drive a car because of the possibility of siezures.</p>

<p>Linda drove me home to pick up a few things. I am going back to
sit with David tonight until he goes to sleep. I will stay at cousin
Sharon's house so I can be back at the hospital in time to be there
when Dr. Pant discusses the results of the tests they did to
ascertain the degree of motility in the digestive tract.</p>

<p>Ken is sitting with David. After David gave his dinner to Ken, he
started telling Ken about the "stuff" in the back yard and what
should happen to it. Lucky Ken!</p>

<p>Need to hit the road. I will fill you all in again tomorrow.</p>

<p>Subject: David Update</p>

<p>We met with the radiologist today. He was forthright with us. He
showed us the mri of David's brain. He showed us multiple brain
tumors--7 or more small ones and one big one. Some of the smaller
ones are in the thalamus, the part of the brain that controls the
autonomic functions like respiration, heart rate, body temperature.
Those are troublesome and need to be knocked down. There is one large
tumor, about an inch by an inch and a half by and inch and a quarter.
It is causing swelling in the brain and is probably responsible for a
large part of David's nausea and some of the feeling of fullness and
pain.</p>

<p>David has been given a steroid medication to reduce the swelling
in the brain. It does not come without its own side effects, one of
which is to make his blood sugar fluctuate wildly.</p>

<p>The doctor is recommending a 15 day vigorous radiation session
with the goal of minimizing neurologic damage, reducing David's
nausea and getting him off of the steroid.</p>

<p>This will be concurrent with the radiation therapy for the
esophageal cancer. The goal of the radiation therapy for the
esophagus will be to keep David's esophagus open so he can eat, to
stop or at least reduce the bleeding so David doesn't have to go to
the emergency room for blood every week, and to get David home, where
the bacteria are a little more friendly (not antibiotic resistant)
than the ones lying about the hospital. The overall goal for the
radiation is to give David the best possible quality of life for the
time he has left.</p>

<p>We were satisfied with the explanations and rationale given.</p>

<p>We appreciate the notes of encouragement, the good thoughts and
the prayers on our behalf.</p>

starting Monday.</p>

<p>He is really looking forward to being home.</p>

<p>David was supposed to be released today. That is not going to
happen. That is a mixed blessing because we are having the worst
storm of the winter today and I was really not wanting to be out on
the road.</p>

<p>They need to give him another 2 units of blood. They want to
figure out where the blood is going. They say it is not appearing in
his stools. They don't know whether it is a matter of not producing
RBC or whether he is bleeding out somewhere.</p>

<p>He has gained 22 lbs, and that is not muscle or fat! They need to
pull some of that liquid off of him before they will let him go. I am
guessing the decadron is doing that. Of course, nobody pays much
attention to what I think.</p>

<p>Guess I can go upstairs and work on decluttering.</p>

<p>I just talked to David on the phone. He may not be released until
Tuesday. They are still trying to pull the excess fluid off of him.
They gave him another 2 units of blood. There is a question of where
that blood is going. It looks like they may have to do a bone marrow
exam to determine whether he is able to make blood.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I have come down with a cold. I still have the
occasional sneeze and my nose is sore from wiping it. I think it is
just as well that I not go to see him today, and that I did not go
there yesterday. He doesn't need a cold on top of everything
else.</p>

<p>I have been remiss in doing the updates. David called me Sunday
morning and said to come get him, he could come home.</p>

<p>So, David is home and my apologies to those who made the trek to
Lewiston to visit. I can only plead innocent by reason of having a
cold. My prayer is that David does not catch it. Count how many times
one can wash ones hands during the day!</p>

<p>Nine out of twenty five radiation treatments to his esophagus are
down and two out of 15 on his head. He still maintains a cheery out
look and is looking towards involvement in some of his day to day
activities.</p>

<p>Today he had a dental appointment, radiation therapy, and went to
visit friend Dianne Milhollin who had heart bypass surgery the same
day David was admitted for chemo. Dianne is recuperating in a nursing
home for a couple of weeks before she can go home. I am pleased that
he is ready to "get back into life".</p>

<p>Subject: Re: update</p>

<p>I have been reminded from time to time what strength I have. I
have been through a lot. Maybe adversity builds strength. However, in
this situation, I believe that my strength comes from a strong
relationship with my God and with my DH. It also comes from the fact
that I have no choice. We have to go through this--the only way out
is through it. I come from the school that says you do what you have
to do.</p>

<p>I have been on the edge of losing him numerous times when he gave
himself too much insulin in the evening and had a MAJOR reaction
during the night. He would be having convulsions and that would be
what awakened me. I guess there has been an awareness that I would
probably outlive him, but thought it would be the diabetes that got
him.</p>

<p>He has had two significant insulin reactions in the last two days.
I don't know what is going on. It scares me because I can't tell by
looking whether he is just exhausted, whether he is nauseous, or
whether he is having a low blood sugar. He used to sweat profusely
when his blood sugar was low. That has not happened with these low
blood sugar episodes. I don't know whether he is miscalculating his
dose of insulin or whether the cancer/chemo/radiation has altered
what he needs, or whether he is overestimating how much he is eating.
Have to ask the Dr. about this. I know that I now need to learn to
calculate his dose so I can double check.</p>

<p>I would rather lose him than have him suffer. Watching the
suffering, physical and emotional, that is the really hard part.
There is nothing I can do to ease the suffering and I am afraid the
suffering has only just begun.</p>

<p>The oncologist told us she would probably not do the second round
of chemo. That means she thinks the cost to his quality of life would
be greater than anything he might gain from it. I hope he can have
some quality time after the radiation and the recovery from that.</p>

<p>Good news: His hematocrit is up to 13, meaning that he is now
making blood faster than he is losing it. The radiation has stopped
or slowed down the bleeding in his esophagus.</p>

<p>He has been a member of Toastmasters for some 20 years. The local
club has become a kind of support group for him. He went last night
and even gave a talk. He dedicated the talk to another friend and
Toastmaster who had quadruple bypass surgery the day David started
his chemo. He got a standing ovation. I encourage him to do whatever
he thinks he can do and will give him some joy.</p>

<p>Subject: David Update 3/20/03</p>

<p>David is now over half way through his radiation treatments. He
missed one Monday. He walked into the office and vomited. They were
afraid he might do the same while they were treating him and that
could have terrible results. He was very disappointed.</p>

<p>When he came out from his shower yesterday he was a tad touchy. He
yelled at me that he needed to have food. I was so startled! I also
was a tad touchy. I said "Okay. This is not my fault!" Then he told
me that he had lost 12 pounds in the last 4 days and he was scared. I
told him that he looked dehydrated and needed to drink more.</p>

<p>Several times over the past few days I have heard David telling
folks that he would be having surgery. I know that sometimes when
people hear bad news their info intake system shuts down because they
are not ready to handle any more information. I think that is what
happened with David. He simply thought he was going to get better
after he had the surgery. I felt he needed to know that there was
going to be no surgery before the time came and the surgery didn't.
Last night I told him I didn't think there was going to be surgery.
He was quite startled and a little angry. He asked who changed that.
I explained that Dr. Anderson had told us that this was a whole new
ball game when they found the brain mets. He told us the plan now was
to keep David as comfortable as possible and to try to keep his
esophagus open by the radiation. Dr. Anderson explained that those
mets in the brain were blood seeded and that the cancer could show up
anywhere. David didn't remember hearing any of that. It was very
awkward for a while. He said "You mean I'm on the way out?!!!" I told
him that was very likely. Then he asked if everyone knew but him. I
told him that they all knew it was a very bad situation. He was very
quiet for a long time.</p>

<p>I then reminded him of the day Dr. Pant came and told him the mri
had shown brain tumors and that had changed the whole program. This
was now metastatic disease. Did he remember me asking the prognosis
and time range? He said no. I asked if he remembered her telling him
he might need to make his living will and tend to other end of life
issues. He said no. I told him he needed to check with Dr. Pant. We
obviously remembered different things. So that is on his list of
questions for today when he sees her.</p>

<p>Later David started sorting through some of the books and things
in the living room. He sat and looked at one book for quite a while.
He put it on the dining room table. We finally started crying, both
of us realizing that the end is coming. Then David took me to the
dining table where he had that book laid out.</p>

<p>He asked me to read what was there. It was an old songbook and the
song was "Believe Me, If All Those Endearing Young Charms". We both
cried as he told me that had been his grandparent's favorite song and
that it applied especially to me. Then he asked if it would be too
awful to have it sung at his funeral as his message to all his family
and friends. I told him I though that would be beautiful.</p>

<p>I had a session with the dietitian yesterday. We talked about how
to get the maximum calories into the minimum amount of food for David
without running his blood sugar over the top. Fat and Protein. Hide
cheese in everything. Make rich sauces and gravies. Keep the food
moist and soft. All day grazing rather than large meals.</p>

<p>David is to ask Dr. Pant for assistance in calculation of his
insulin dose. She is to write down the response so I can help double
check what David is doing, and eventually be able to do that myself
when he can't. His blood sugars have been all over the map. That is
due to the steroid medication, not what we are or are not doing. The
fact that his low blood sugar episodes have changed their character
and I can't tell by looking that it is low, and the fact that he
doesn't feel or can't recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar is
very scary. I know we are going to need to do many more blood tests
than the 4 a day he had been doing.</p>

<p>David is kind of off and on with his eating. He is so distraught
about the war. When the doctor asked him Monday what was most
difficult for him he answered "This Iraq situation!"</p>

<p>At this point, I am trying to keep him from hearing the news. That
is something we can't do anything about and he doesn't need to spend
his precious time stewing about "the war".</p>

<p>Time to pray for miracles--peace of mind and peace in the
world.</p>

<p>It seems my days and nights are full. I appreciate the support
that has been shown to us in so many lovely ways.</p>

<p>David has finished 21 of 25 radiation treatments. The radiation is
taking its toll. He is extremely tired and has quite the sore throat.
Most of what I fix for him to eat is in a cream sauce which helps it
to slip down easily.</p>

<p>His blood sugars are still fluctuating wildly. A consult with our
physician might have given us a solution but David decided it wasn't
working and went back to his old ways, which were not working. I
should have it down pat now that really extreme tiredness and
dizziness it low blood sugar. I still forget. However, when I do tell
him that his blood sugar is low, he gets upset and yells that "I am
not having low blood sugar!" If he then goes and checks it, he will
come back and sheepishly say "I had low blood sugar."</p>

<p>He is being very gracious about saying goodbye to his treasures of
the last 60+ years, stuff that has weighted us down and cluttered our
lives and our surroundings. Brother Steve and sister, Linda and their
spouses have done so much to help with the sorting, the throwing and
most important, the transporting of stuff to good will, the recycle
center and the dump. Cousin Marilyn and brother Erin are currently in
town and assisting with "the project".</p>

<p>I have my answer down pat for when one of them asks if I want
something--I don't want it, to the dump, to the dump, to the dump,
dump, dump! Many of the items end up in the Goodwill bin.</p>

<p>Yesterday David was a little sad when he ushered out his 50 or so
years of photographic magazines. He has been the family guru on
matters photographic. If he didn't know the answer off the top of his
head, he knew just what issue of which magazine to get the answer.
That is a resource that will be much missed by myself and others in
the family. When I wanted a digital camera for my beadwork and
website, he started studying the matter. He chose the Nikon 950 and I
have loved it dearly. When I was preparing to go to Egypt, he studied
the cameras and chose a Minolta for me. I loved that camera and the
twin we bought a few years later.</p>

<p>Thursday when Steven took David to Lewiston, they stopped at the
foot of the grade where some metalwork statues honoring the Lewis and
Clark explorations are abeing installed. David took some wonderful
pictures. I will try to get them scanned and up in the next week.</p>

<p>There is so much intelligence, knowledge, artistry and skill going
down the drain here. It breaks my heart.</p>

<p>Well, it is time to head for church.</p>

<p>Until next time,</p>

<p>Whew! It has been a busy few days. David's cousin, Marilyn was in
town to visit for a few days. Cousin Rose Alene met her in Lewiston
at the airport. She stayed with David's mother while in Moscow and
she also visited David's sister, Linda and Cousin Rose Alene. It was
a delight to have some time with her.</p>

<p>David had a birthday coming up. He told me he didn't want
anything. He wanted a "take it away" party. Saturday, March 29, Ken
and Linda and son Brant, Marilyn, Steve and Chris, and I all met at
our garage and we started sorting and tossing. We filled Ken's truck
with metal stuff for a run to the dump. Since it can be recycled, it
doesn't cost to get rid of it. Then, we had a run to Good Will. David
wandered around and supervised.</p>

<p>Linda then announced that she had received an email from Toni
saying brother Erin would be arriving in Moscow about 11:40 AM. He
was going to surprise us. Instead, we all went to the airport to meet
him and he is the one who got a surprise. He also helped in the
sorting. He said he was saved by distance (He lives in Fairbanks, AK)
from taking all of that "good stuff" home.</p>

<p>Sunday March 30 was David's 64th birthday. We had a family
get-together at his mother's house. It was another terrific Talbott
pot luck. I will see if I can remember everyone that was there:
Jeanette, his mother; Steve, his brother and Chris, Steve's wife.
Steve and Chris's daughter Hillary and her boyfriend Mark; Erin,
David's brother, Ken, and Linda and their son, Brant; Ivan, David's
cousin, and his wife Judee; Loyal and Frances, David's aunt and
uncle; cousin Sharon; Aunt Glenda; cousin Marilyn; dear friends David
and Sharyn; friend Jim, and David and I.</p>

<p>David noted that it would probably be his last birthday and that
was probably okay. He thanked everybody for the part they had played
in his life. Jeanette reminded him that we would all be together
again on the other side. I told him to leave sign posts for the rest
of us. We all enjoyed a great dinner complete with birthday cake and
ice cream. Afterward, Erin, David and Jim went out to the airport to
see Jim's plane and do some airport bumming.</p>

<p>Monday Erin drove us to Lewiston for David's radiation therapy. We
got to watch the procedure which was the last radiation to his brain.
We sat in the waiting room afterwards and worked on the jigsaw
puzzle.</p>

<p>Tuesday Erin spend most of the day with David and took him around
to do some of the errands that I had not been able to work into my
schedule yet. They rode to Lewiston together with David's friend, Ed,
who was driving that day. Tuesday night Erin went back to
Fairbanks.</p>

<p>David has now parceled out his bear collection: Gritman Hospital
took the larger bears for their teddy bear clinic, the Moscow EMT's
took a box for trauma bears, the historical society took a couple for
their collection, the Lewiston Police Department took some for trauma
bears. We have saved some of the more special (to us) bears.</p>

<p>He has one more radiation treatment tomorrow. After 3-4 weeks
there will be a repeat of his MRI and CT scans to see how effective
the treatments have been. They are starting to taper off his steroid
medication. Once he is off of that, his diabetes should be easier to
manage. His head and face look like the end of the summer tan is on
them. His back is red and his neck is red. He has no significant
pain, other than a sore throat, at this time. We pray that will be
the story through all of this. This week he only lost 1 pound, so we
are doing a better job of finding things he will eat.</p>

<p>We are having more moments when we just look at each other and
cry. Words cannot express what we are feeling.</p>

<p>Updates will probably be spaced further apart for a while, now
that the major interaction with the medical community will be over.
Certainly any significant events will be reported as will any
significant medical changes.</p>

<p>Time to go to bed!</p>

<p>Subject: David and Karen update</p>

<p>Another week gone. We spent this week visiting a lawyer, talking
to a financial advisor and on Monday morning I saw an orthopedic
surgeon. When we finish with the lawyer and the financial advisor,
David will have most of his legal and financial affairs in order. It
has been a sobering experience to have a will drawn up, with the
awareness that it may be less than a year until it is needed.</p>

<p>The orthopod told me there was some good news and some bad news.
The good news is that my left knee does not need a replacement. The
bad news is that I have a torn meniscus. The repair for the torn
meniscus will involve arthroscopic surgery followed by some days in
bed and some period of physical therapy.</p>

<p>My question was "Should I have it done now or wait and hope I can
last through the next year and taking care of David?" The consensus
was to have it done in the next few weeks, after David has
recuperated from the chemo and radiation therapy. I am looking at the
7th of May as a possible time. I know I have aggravated it with the
multiple trips up and down stairs with laundry in the basement and
the clean out upstairs, not to mention the many trips outside with
heavy boxes, and the hours of standing and sorting in the garage. I
wish I could have all of that clean out done before the surgery, but
I know that is not going to happen. There will be plenty of time
after I have recovered.</p>

<p>I think David is now off of the Decadron (a glucosteroid used to
reduce swelling in the brain, especially during radiation therapy).
It appears to me that he is having more nausea and vomiting, more
dizziness, and more difficulty writing. I also think he is more
volatile emotionally. I hope these symptoms will improve as his body
once again starts producing its own steroids. About half of the time,
I am now doing his blood sugar tests because his hands shake too much
for him to manage it. I am trying to reintroduce some vegetables into
his diet (and mine). We have eaten a lot of cabbage, cauliflower,
broccoli, onions and carrots over the years. David doesn't want to
eat anything that causes gas because it tends to make him vomit more
and to have abdominal and chest pain. I steamed some squash and
mashed it with lots of butter tonight. That went down fairly well. I
gave him some hominy with a cheese sauce at lunch and that went down
pretty well. It is really straining my brain to try to think of
things to fix which will go down easily and taste good, provide lots
of Calories and not raise his blood sugar over the top.</p>

<p>On his better days, when the weather cooperates, he tries to get
outside and putter a little in the garden. He planted our peas
yesterday. Spring is beginning to happen around here with some
tulips, daffodils, narcissus, hyacinth, scilla, and forsithia
blooming.</p>

<p>I spent the better part of a couple of days this week out in the
garage. Today Steve took one truck load to Good Will and one truck
load to the dump. I am at a point where I need to import some muscle.
This week, in addition to the stuff now gone from the garage, I
unearthed a computer terminal, an IBM selectric typewriter, parts for
the Mazda 626 (which has been gone for 6-7 years) and the good
electric hedge trimmer that he has not been able to find in the past
several years.</p>

<p>Taxes have been left on the back burner. I am going to have to get
an extension--soon! I think I have most of the needed information,
but I can't figure out where and how to put it into the "simplified"
form.</p>

<p>Today we watched a videotapes of couple of old movies on the TV.
We really enjoyed Follow Me and David especially enjoyed Song of the
South with Uncle Remus. This is the first time in quite a while that
David has had any interest in watching anything. Then, we also
watched the British humor that is on Idaho Public Television on
Saturday evenings.</p>

<p>It is time for another blood sugar test, and then on to bed.</p>

<p>Goodness, a lot has happened!</p>

<p>Ruby and Ethan (daughter and grandson) were here for a few days
before Easter. It was so good to see them. That doesn't happen very
often. Ethan and I had some fun with wire and beads.</p>

<p>It is almost a month since David finished his radiation therapy. I
don't know where the time goes! Tomorrow (Wed. Apr. 30) he goes back
to Lewiston for CT scan and brain MRI to see how effective the
treatments were. The following Tuesday (May 6) we will see Dr. Pant
to get the results and ask a few questions.</p>

<p>He hasn't much appetite, but still eats fairly well. However, I
can't get used to having leftovers still left when I go to prepare
the next meal. He seems to be able to eat most things, now, as long
as he really chews them up. We are still avoiding gas formers,
however. He has a chronic stomach ache. I don't know if there is
going to be any relief for that.</p>

<p>He has been complaining of an itchy back for a long time. It got
so bad it was about to drive him berserk. I finally drug him to the
doctor. I can't remember what name the doctor gave it--something with
" _____ graphic syndrome" in the name. Wherever something rubs his
skin, it causes a histamine reaction with all the red skin, welts,
and itching that goes with it. His histamine system is all out of
wack. He was given 2 antihistamines and 2 supressors of
pre-histamines. He no longer is digging at himself. He sleeps. I
don't know if that is a really good trade.</p>

<p>On the clean-up front, 2 more truck loads left the garage a week
ago Saturday.</p>

<p>Ken and Linda came with a truck. We spent the morning loading
stuff for the dump. After lunch, we loaded metal stuff that Ken will
sift through and recycle. My car is now in the garage for the first
time in 20 years. There is a pile of lumber, some old shelves, and a
couple of old chests that are ready to go to the dump. There is still
a lot of short lumber pieces that David stashed in the joists in the
ceiling of the garage. For now, I will not worry about the cases of
Kodak carousels and other photo stuff in the attic of the garage.</p>

<p>When I went to the West End of the garage to look for something, I
said "Oh My God!" I guess it has been a long time since I went into
that corner. It looks like giant jackstraws with lumber thrown in
every direction, along with about 20 tires, and God only knows what
else. That will be there to entertain me after my knee recovers from
the surgery.</p>

<p>My knee surgery is scheduled for May 7. Linda is going to come
take care of us while I am confined to bed. We will also be starting
with Hospice. I am concerned because David no longer recognizes low
blood sugar until he is so low he is unable to do anything about it.
He had 3 fairly severe hypoglycemic attacks in one 24 hour period. We
have both tried to step up our awareness of where his blood sugar
level is. I do many blood sugar measurements for him. I just don't
know what to do with the numbers when I get them. He was rather
hostile when I suggested that he may need to cut back on the amount
of insulin he was taking. He yelled that he needed to eat more often
(implying that it was my fault that he was not getting meals and
snacks when he needed them).</p>

<p>I think David is still physically capable of getting up and
walking into the kitchen to get a snack. He doesn't do it. I am
wondering if the brain lesions may be making David unable to act in
ways he knows he should. He says he thinks about all the things he
"should" be doing, but can't get his butt out of the chair to do
it.</p>

<p>At first David thought hospice was a good idea. Now he is
resisting it. I would guess that it is one more loss of control for
him. I don't know whether the difficulty managing his diabetes is the
way he is (or isn't) doing it, or whether it is an effect of the
cancer.</p>

<p>We are ever appreciative of the cards, phone calls, prayers and
good thoughts coming our way. A week ago, one of David's friends from
Toastmasters arrived with his lawn mower. He made quick work of
mowing our lawn. Thanks, Ed!</p>

<p>I guess I have rambled on long enough.</p>

<p>The weeks roll around. Tomorrow I have my pre surgery stuff done
and Wed. is the day. It is my left knee. I had to go off of my
arthritis medicine on Friday. Now I really know how much it helps!
I'm movin' real slow tonight! Hardly moving at all.</p>

<p>David's sister is coming to stay with us for 4-5 days, until I
sort of have</p>

<p>my feet back under me. Friends who have had the arthroscopic
surgery say it takes a while to recover, but once healed it is like
magic.</p>

<p>David is having a rough day. It makes me feel so helpless when his
food</p>

<p>comes back faster than he can eat it. That, of course, leads to
insulin reactions. When I realized he was hypoglycemic and not just
sleeping, I gave him some grape juice and some glucose. His Blood
Sugar was 37 and he was starting to seize. Later I asked what he
remembered about this latest hypoglycemic attack. He asked which one.
He didn't know he had one. I suggested that he maybe needed to eat
first and see if it was going to stay before he loaded up on insulin.
He said maybe he needed to check his blood sugar first, then take his
insulin. DUH!</p>

<p>It is not a good sign, I think, that he is so nauseous and having
a hard time holding down his food. We get a report on his CT and MRI
tomorrow when we see Dr. Pant. We will also ask if there is any
solution for his constant stomach ache. That is really getting to
him.</p>

<p>From my reading, I think there is a surgery where they cut a nerve
to relieve the pain of esophageal cancer. That would take a lot out
of him, too. This cancer game has damn few plusses and lots of "catch
22's".</p>

<p>David is planning on delivering the sermon at church next Sunday.
I won't be able to go. I hope they will record it for me. At least,
that gives David something to think about besides his situation. I
hope he will be up to it. Interaction with other people seems to give
him some extra energy.</p>

<p>Next question is--do I dare go to bed and leave David on his own?
Blood sugar is up to 79. That means he probably needs to eat
something. Nothing sounds good to him. I guess that means I will hang
around for a while and watch him.</p>

<p>Subject: David 5/17/03</p>

<p>We have been dealing with Home Health for about half a week now.
Ava, our nurse is a really sweet lady and she has a good feel for how
David ticks. Now, I have someone I can call when I am unsure about
what to do next. I did just that this morning.</p>

<p>David has been vomiting a lot these past few days. He doesn't eat
much and doesn't retain much of what he does eat. This morning he is
vomiting blood. I called and asked about that. Ava gave me some
reassurance that vomiting blood is expected when the cancer is in his
esophagus and stomach.</p>

<p>David has not been able to keep down his antinausea medicine. That
can be administered rectally and Ava said she could do that if he
didn't keep his pills down this morning. I don't see any point in
giving him his other medicine--pain medicine--if he can't even keep
down his antinausea medicine. He keeps asking what he ate last night
that was so dark. I guess I shall have to tell him. God, I hate
this!</p>

<p>Ava suggested that David might like to reconsider his stance on
Hospice. Maybe, after he learns that he is vomiting blood, he will
reconsider. I am thinking he will need blood soon at the rate he has
been throwing it up this morning. I suspect he was losing it before
through his stool, maybe just not such a large amount all at once.
This may mean that the oncologist will want to start another round of
chemo. It looks like some difficult decisions coming up.</p>

<p>I called Ava again. David just keeps upchucking. He has lost a
fair amount of blood by now. It is time for Hospice. David may end up
in the hospital to get him stabilized this morning. I keep looking at
the living room and the dining room and wondering where to put a
hospital bed. I may soon have to call in recruits to help move
furniture.</p>

<p>It is now evening. David has been admitted to the hospital. He was
told that he needs to rethink his stand on Hospice. (Hospice or a
nursing home was what the doctor told me.) The Doctor told me to stay
away from the hospital for at least 24 hours and to get some rest.
Linda came up from Cherry Lane and stayed with me until David was
admitted, then she took me for dinner.</p>

<p>I am hoping they can get a regimen going with his insulin while he
is in the hospital that I will be able to continue. This
roller-coaster ride and the moodiness that go with it are too much to
deal with on top of the cancer.</p>

<p>David did say that he was now ready for Hospice when he gets out
of the hospital. That is a big hurdle jumped. They will help get the
equipment we need, his medications, direction for me so I know what
the H--- I am doing.</p>

<p>Now, I am going to kick off my shoes, turn on the TV and vegetate
for the rest of the evening.</p>

<p>Whew! David went to the hospital Saturday. I came home and started
getting ready to have a hospital bed and other miscellaneous
equipment in our living room. Sunday I went to church and sang with
the choir on the last appearance of the season. Then, I took David's
mother out to lunch and we commiserated a little bit. I got home and
Linda and Ken appeared, then Steve and Chris arrived. they helped
move the large furniture around, cleaned out the ancient dust bunnies
that were living under the furniture, cleaned the maple flowers off
of the patio and walk, mowed the lawn and then took me out to dinner
again.</p>

<p>I went to the hospital today and we made arrangements for Hospice
care. The equipment had to be ready for him before he could come
home. He is now on the pain patch and has a few other medications.
The bed is in the living room and when the blind is pulled up he can
look outside. He can see the TV and there are places for a few people
to sit when they visit.</p>

<p>The doctor talked to me and suggested that we not treat the
diabetes. It is so difficult if his food intake is variable. If he
has insulin, then he has to try to eat to balance the insulin to
avoid a crash. He doesn't want to eat or drink anything.</p>

<p>When he saw the Hospice nurse this morning, she asked how he was
doing. He said he was going down hill fast. She told me that David's
death is "imminant", whatever that means. David asked Dr. Rice how
long he had and Dr. Rice hedged. He told David that he looked strong
enough to hang around for a long time.</p>

<p>So now I believe we are in the last leg of this journey. I am
exhausted and numb.</p>

<p>Subject: David 5/23/03</p>

<p>We are now 4 days into Hospice care.  Our nurse is the same one we
had with home health and she is still a sweetie.</p>

<p>I have taken over the administration of medications and management
of David's diabetes.  The diabetes is not manageable, but we work at
it.  David was getting very angry with me because I was not giving
him as much insulin as he thought he should receive.  I am using the
sliding scale the doctor gave us plus a little extra insulin.  One
time when I went to give him his insulin, he asked how much I was
giving him and what his blood sugar was  I told him and he said he
didn't want to take that amount because it wasn't enough.  Then he
yelled at me that I was not giving him enough insulin to allow him to
eat!!!!  I suggested that we start with that amount and then, if he
needed more, we could get it later.  He reluctantly agreed.  I
pointed out that he was hardly eating anything anyway.  The last time
the nurse was here, she asked if there were any other questions
before she left.  David did not ask about the insulin so I told her
he was concerned.</p>

<p>She explained that when diabetics become ill, their blood sugars
escalate to high levels.  David is very sick and his body is
responding with high blood sugars.  She told him that because he was
so sick, they wanted to be very gentle with his diabetes and they
didn't want him to have the low blood sugars he had been having.  So,
they were going to try to keep his blood sugars at a higher level
than he had been doing.  She also explained that his body mass was
much smaller now than it was 20 years ago.  He seemed to understand
and accept what she was saying.</p>

<p>He usually does not admit to having pain.  Last night he was very
restless.  He told me he hurt everywhere.  I offered him his morphine
and he declined.  I think he is concerned about becoming addicted to
the morphine.  Thank God we now have pain patches.  The pain medicine
goes through the skin over a period of three days.  I think David's
system sucks all of the medicine out of the patch in 2 days, leaving
him suffering for the 3rd day.  I must remember to not call his
additional pain medicine "morphine" and to ask about changing it
every 2 days or getting a stronger patch.</p>

<p>We have orders for a CNA to come help him bathe.  I think he heard
us talking about it Wednesday because that night he pulled himself
together and went in to take a shower.  He always does these things
when I am not looking!  I was changing into my nightie and when I
came out of the bedroom, he was in the shower.</p>

<p>Thursday morning, I was in the shower when I heard a loud thump in
the living room.  I grabbed a towel and ran in to see what was going
on.  David had tried to move his table and when it wouldn't move, he
pushed it over--a little temper tantrum, I suspect.</p>

<p>I have put my telephone that has a radio in it next to his bed so
he can tune in the Mariner's baseball games and listen to the oldies
but goodies station.</p>

<p>It is now Saturday Afternoon and David had a shower.  He sits on a
shower chair and uses the shower hose,  Then he stands up and I move
the chair out onto the bathroom floor.  He steps out of the shower
and sits on the bench.  I dry him, put lotion on his skin and help
him get into his pajamas.  Then he heads back to bed and conks out
for a while.</p>

<p>He is eating very little and whatever he does eat comes back up. 
I am wondering if he has an obstruction caused by the cancer.  He is
so thin.  It almost scares me to try to give him his insulin in his
arm.</p>

<p>The bill came today from the hospital in Lewiston.  Oh my!  They
apparently  have not submitted it to David's insurance, yet.  It
should be covered 100%,  They say no insurance is pending and that we
owe the whole amount.  I tried to call and got a voicemail.  Oh!  It
is Saturday and they wouldn't be working today!  For some reason, I
seem to stay a little rattled.</p>

<p>My checkup with the surgeon went well.  I can bend my knee far
enough and I can do straight leg lifts.  I can not get my leg
straight and I have a hard time standing up, especially from a low
chair.  I have been threatened with physical terrorism if I can't get
my knee straight by the next appointment in one month.  He gave me a
passive stretching exercise.  He wants me to work up to 15 minutes. 
I am yelling "Uncle" after about 45 seconds.  I have a lot more pain
after trying to do that exercise.</p>

<p>It is about time for me to try to get a little nap while David is
sleeping.  Any suggestions for supper?</p>

<p>Subject: 5/27/03 David--a call for anecdotes!</p>

<p>We are slowly getting into a routine with the blood glucose
testing and the medications.  We are not "routine" people, so it is a
challange.  I do hate to awaken David when he is sleeping.  His bed
has been so miserable for him that he has spent a lot of time in his
recliner.  Even with a donut cusion, he has developed a bed sore on
the skin over his tailbone.</p>

<p>I asked the nurse about The lack of comfort in David's bed and she
checked the air mattress on it and had a fit.  It was not what she
ordered, and it had little air in it.  She called the supplier and
chewed on them a bit.  This afternoon they brought the air mattress
system that she wanted.  It has cell of air that inflate and deflate.
 They act to keep the pressure points moving and help to prevent
bedsores.  Then, she put a dressing over the sore, and another
dressing to hold the first one in place.  She will have to come back
and re-do it tomorrow because in his moving around, he managed to
roll up the dressings and make a big bump there.  I tugged and pulled
on it to try to smooth it down.  It will be okay if he doesn't sit on
it.</p>

<p>After a full day of visitors, the nurse, the supply people, the
pastor, friends and family, he was pooped.  He got on his bed with
the new air mattress and fell asleep while listening to the Mariner's
baseball game.  He looks more comfortable than I have seen him since
we got the hospital bed.</p>

<p>The pastor was here to discuss David's funeral.  Sister Linda said
she didn't want to talk about that.  It turned into a fun session of
story telling and reminiscing. We would like to give you all the
opportunity to share any stories about David.   The stories should be
brief.  Some of them will be shared at the funeral which will be a
celebration of David's life.</p>

<p>When Roger, our pastor, asked if there was anything David wanted
or absolutely didn't want, David said he wanted the absolutely
cheapest funeral money could buy.  Roger told David he would cut his
fee in half for me.</p>

<p>He eats and drinks very little.  I am still having a hard time
with that.  He still insists he can get up and go to the bathroom and
take a shower.  I am having a hard time with that.  He is so weak.  I
can vouch for the fact that there is very little muscle left on his
body.</p>

<p>He is awake now, and I need to go poke him again.</p>

<p>Know that David is spiritually ready to meet his Maker.  His

things have been taken care of.  I want for him to be able to depart
freely when the time comes, for him to have his Easter.</p>

<p>Tonight his pain level has been higher than usual.  He accepted

<p>The service was very nice. Poignant all the time, pretty funny
when the stories were being shared. Several people spoke, some whom I
didn't know, and others I did like, Roger H., Aleta, Loyal F. The
United Church was indeed full, spilling down the hall and into a
second room which had sound. Music was provided by David and Karen's
neighbors who teach and play cello as well as play piano. Also,
Jeanette's roomer, Matt, played piano to accompany a very nice
soprano he knows.</p>

<p>Afterwards, the congregation supplied a very tasty lunch where
nearly everyone ate and chatted for nearly two more hours. For me,
meeting a few I haven't seen for a long time was special as well as
Ted C. and George B., who drove from Billings for the service. He
stayed with Ivan.</p>

<p>Much to my surprise after earlier rumors, about 14 of us went to
Whelan Cemetary to scatter David's ashes Sunday afternoon. After
church, a drive out to the DeWitt house for a tour, then lunch at
Steve's, we piled into four vehicles for the drive out. Attending
were Karen, Jeanette, Erin and Toni, Steve and Chris, Hillary, Maria
and Shannon, Linda and Ken, Roger, George B., myself, and Roger, the
minister. After the minister spoke a few words, we checked the wind
direction and Erin scattered his ashes. Then Karen scattered some
beads and the rest of us scattered rose petals which Linda had
thoughtlfully brought. We stayed for a little while absorbing the
moment(s), enjoying the indigenous Palouse, the verdant green of the
tilled fields, the cloudless sky. Lo! If Loyal T. didn't find his way
up the rather steep hill to where we all were. It was absolutely
memorable. I am still surprised how generous this family is to me: I
know I am not 'blood' and am prepared always to respect family events
to be exclusive - but they've never been for me. I am made greater
for these acts of generosity.</p>
