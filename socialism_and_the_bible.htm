<p><font color="#660099" size="+4">Socialism and the Bible</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">"And I shall shake all nations, and the desire of
all nations shall come "-Haggai II, 7.</font></p></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="+1">A few years ago, Socialism was advocated only by
theorists. It was merely an academic question, and practical men
smiled at it. Today it is a living and actively growing international
force.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">What is the reason of this? Are there grounds of
complaint against the past and present 'nodes of government and
social order? The answer is undoubtedly in the affirmative. There are
many grounds of discontent, but they can be gathered together into
three main lines of argument.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The first main line of argument is the argument
from justice; the second, the argument from economy; and the third,
the argument from necessity. First, as regards the</font></p>

<p><font color="#0033FF" size="+3"><i>Argument from
Justice:</i></font><font size="+1"> </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Socialists point out that those who possess honor
and riches are not by any means always the most worthy. Very often
they have less ability and honesty than many less fortunate in the
struggle for existence. This ought not to be. Every man should start
life alike in opportunity; society should not show favoritism at the
beginning nor in any period of life. If a man is to be rewarded in
any way, it ought to be on account of his merits, and not from mere
accident of birth, or because he has more backstairs influence than
his neighbors. On the other hand, if a man is to be poor and of low
station in life, it ought to be as a penalty for wrong doing, and not
because he cannot get a living wage, or on account of failure to find
employment though anxious for it. That is the argument from justice.
Then the second argument, the</font></p>

<p><font color="#0033FF" size="+3">Argument from Economy: </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">What wastage there is in the present competitive
system! Besides the enormous expenditure in advertising and touting
for orders, there is the deterioration of goods owing to
overproduction, and the manufacture of shoddy materials to cut
prices. Again, consider the waste of money, time, and Saviour
involved in the present overlapping both in the manufacture of goods,
and in their delivery. Compare, for instance, the delivery of letters
with that of stores. If, in place of the present competition, there
was only a joint and orderly system of production and distribution,
what an immense saving would be effected! That is the argument from
economy. Thirdly, there is the </font></p>

<p><font color="#0033FF" size="+3">Argument from
Necessity:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We see, as we look around us, that the social
conditions are not right. Hundreds of thousands are badly clad, badly
fed, badly housed. When we turn to the Saviour conditions, we see
thousands out of employment, and tens of thousands overworked, and
underpaid. Then again, when we consider the physical and mental
conditions of the people, we see much distress and suffering. The
asylums and hospitals are growing in size and number year by year,
yet they are always filled to overflowing; and outside of these
institutions there are great multitudes of both rich and poor, who
are completely or partially disabled, mentally and physically. No
doubt much of this disability is beyond the power of the physical and
social reformer to remove; but some of it, at least, could be
overcome by proper laws and regulations, more especially if the
wealth of the country was in the hands of the nation. Again, when we
look into the moral conditions of the people, we find that the
present system is accountable for much. In all large cities thousands
of families are compelled to live in houses of one apartment, and the
poor are crowded into districts badly ventilated, badly lit, and
badly drained. The result is that countless children grow up amidst
the moral and material filth of the slums, and, sad to relate, these
evil influences are not confined to the slums, though most noticeable
there. Such demoralizing conditions ought not to be, and if proper
regulations were enforced, many of these evils could be eradicated
These are the arguments, dear friends, and the last is the most
important. The more we study the whole question, the more we see the
need for drastic reform. Deliverance from the present order of things
is a necessity recognized by all humane and right-thinking
people.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Having thus briefly stated the three main lines of
argument in Saviour of Socialism, let us now ask the question; Is
Socialism practicable? Socialists say that if their principles were
adopted, everyone would experience peace and contentment, and that
thus the desire of all nations would come.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">There are two questions involved here: </font></p>

<center><font color="#0033FF" size="+2">1. Are there any difficulties
in the way of Socialism being established? </font>

<p><font color="#0033FF" size="+2">2. Should it become established,
will the desired ends be gained?</font></p></center>

<p><font size="+1">1. <i>Are there any difficulties in the way of
socialism being established? </i>Yes, there are two chief
difficulties.</font></p>

<dl>
   <dd><font size="+2"><b>(a)</b></font><font size="+1"> The first is
   the indifference of the people, mostly due to the natural mental
   lethargy which opposes all change. But this is being rapidly
   overcome. The people were first awakened to a sense of their
   rights by the Reformation, and later by the French Revolution.
   Both of these great events were largely due to the invention of
   the art of printing, and consequent diffusion of knowledge. Within
   late y~~xxxxx education has become general in all civilized
   xxxxxx~nt. ies, and the cheap literature now flooding the world is
   enlightening the people as never before, and rousing them
   thoroughly to a sense of their rights as men. Because of this, and
   also because of the ready means of intercommunication, the people
   of different countries, even though widely separated, are getting
   acquainted with each other in a way that was not possible in
   former times; and they are gradually realizing a great deal in
   common between them. The prejudices which divide people from
   people are being broken down, and the cry is now becoming
   widespread: "The fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man!"
   The indifference to Socialism is consequently being rapidly
   overcome. Very soon it will be completely dissolved, and then, as
   Daniel foretold when writing prophetically of this period as "the
   time of the end "-the time when "many shall run to and fro, and
   knowledge shall be increased," that is to say, the time when there
   will be free intercommunication between the various peoples and a
   general increase of knowledge-there will be "a time of trouble
   such as never was since there was a nation " Daniel
   12:4.</font></dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd><font size="+2"><b>(b)</b></font><font size="+1"> The other
   difficulty is an even greater obstacle to Socialism becoming
   established. It is the opposition of vested interests. By vested
   interests I mean everything which certain people believe to be
   their rights, whether it be rank, or property, or land, or money'.
   The man who happens to be a king or peer, considers the rank his
   by right. The man who has inherited or bought property or land,
   claims that it belongs to him by right; and the same is true with
   regard to money. More and more opposition will be offered by those
   who possess vested interests, for very few will give up what they
   believe to be their rights simply that the community may benefit.
   All men do not yet love their neighbors as themselves. Before such
   a change can be effected, there must be a moral
   revolution.</font></dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;
   
   <center><font color="#0033FF" size="+2">Men's hearts will first
   require to be changed.</font></center>
   
   <p>&nbsp;</p></dt>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">It is the poor who experience most the
   hardships of the present system, and it is they, as they get
   enlightened, who who are daily swelling the ranks of the
   Socialists, because they think they see in Socialism their only
   hope of relief. The poor say to the rich: "It is all very well for
   you to speak about your rights; but look at us, see how we are
   suffering! You have no moral right to the land, or to so much
   money. It is not fair that any man or woman should possess so much
   when we are denied even the necessities of life." </font></dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">While the Socialists are increasing in number,
   and the outcry against the rich is swelling in volume, the men
   with vested interests, the aristocrats, landowners, property
   owners, and capitalists, and also the church, resent the proposal
   to change the existing social and political arrangements. They
   would like, indeed, to see the people more contented. To this end
   they are willing to grant certain measures of reform; but only so
   long as they can retain their wealth and honors and keep the
   people servile in some degree. The day is past, however, for the
   people to be content with things as they are. As well attempt to
   stem the ocean's flowing tide, as try to check the advance of
   knowledge and truth!</font>
   
   <p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">Within recent years a new political party, the
   Socialist or Social Democrat, has sprung into existence in every
   civilized country; and we should expect that very soon all
   politicians will be either Socialists or Anti-Socialists, although
   they may form themselves into subdivisions. Every thinking man
   sees this at hand. The Anti-Socialist; the aristocrats, the
   capitalists and the church, have the support of those whose
   interests are bound up with theirs, and also of such peace-lovers
   as fear to entrust themselves to the will of the people. But the
   Socialists are demanding and securing reforms, and every success
   makes them eager for greater victories. We cannot suppose that
   those now in authority will long continue to meekly submit; and
   after abortive attempts to obtain their greater desires by
   peaceful means, the people will get impatient at the opposition
   and slowness of reform. Becoming imperative in their demands, they
   will ultimately have recourse to force, and general revolution
   will break out. The people are now bound together to that degree,
   that the war between the masses and the classes will be
   world-wide. The governments will confederate together against
   their common enemy the people; and the people, having tasted the
   sweets of liberty, will break away from the restraint of their
   chosen leaders. Anarchy will ensue, and in the end all the present
   kingdoms and institutions will be overthrown in a time of trouble
   such as never was since there a a nation. </font></dd>
   
   <dt><center><font color="#000099" size="+1">[The present
   world-war, which broke out in August 1914, </font>
   
   <p><font color="#000099" size="+1">is making possible privileges
   for the Social Democrats, </font></p></center></dt>
   
   <dt><center><font color="#000099" size="+1">which were scarcely
   hoped for in Great Britain.] </font>
   
   <p>&nbsp;</p></center>
   
   <p><font size="+1">The people have been likened to a great giant
   who while slumbering in ignorance and superstition, allowed
   himself to be put into bondage. For some time he has been slowly
   wakening, and has already broken several of his fetters. Soon he
   will be fully roused. When he realizes his mighty strength, he
   will burst the remaining bonds in anger, and, rising to his feet,
   will crush the powers that bound him.</font></p></dt>
   
   <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
   
   <dt><font color="#000000" size="+1">Having considered the two
   chief difficulties in the way of the establishment of Socialism,
   and having seen what will occur if the desires of the people are
   not granted, let us now consider what will result should Socialism
   be established.</font></dt>
</dl>

<p><font size="+1">(II) If Socialism is established, whether by
peaceful means or by force, will it work? </font></p>

<center><font color="#0033FF" size="+1">With human nature as it is,
will the desire of all nations be realized through
Socialism?</font></center>

<p><font size="+1">In order to consider this matter fully and
clearly, let us see what Socialism is in its main features. In 1906,
Mr. Robert Blatchford, the well-known Editor of "The Clarion," a
Socialist paper, printed and circulated a leaflet setting forth first
what Socialism is, and then what Socialism is not. The contents are
as follows:</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center><font color="#0033FF" size="+2"><b>What Socialism
Is.</b></font></center>

<dl>
   <dd><font size="+1">Great Britain is ruled by the wealthy in the
   interests of the wealthy. We propose that it should be ruled by
   the people in the interests of the people; for class rule brings
   conflict of interests, which bring hatred, while community of
   interests breeds fellowship, and fellowship is life.</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">All the means of existence in Great Britain
   are owned by individuals. We submit that things which are needful
   to make a nation and maintain &amp; nation should be owned by the
   nation.</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">The nation owns the navy, the government
   factories, the public buildings, the arsenals, the foris, and the
   barracks. We suggest that the nation should own ALL the ships, ALL
   the railways, ALL the factories, ALL the buildings, ALL the land,
   ALL the requisites of national life and defense.</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">8</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">The nation manages the Post Office, the
   Telegraphs, and, through the local councils, it manages many of
   its gasworks, waterworks, and tramway,,. We contend that the
   nation should manage ALL its business and ALL its
   work.</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">The nation directs the people',, morals
   through a State Church, which once a week teaches the wickedness
   of grinding the faces of widows and orphans. We claim that the
   nation should establish social conditions which will make
   oppression and injustice impossible all the week
   round.</font></dd>
</dl>

<center><font size="+1">That is what Socialism is. Then the leaflet
goes on to "say what it is not:</font>

<p><font color="#0033FF" size="+2"><b>What Socialism is
not.</b></font></p></center>

<dl>
   <dd><font size="+1">Those who do not wish you to be Socialists
   have given you very false notions about Socialism, in the hope of
   setting you against it.</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">The men who have tried to smash your unions,
   who have written against you, and spoken against you, and acted
   against you in all the great strikes and lockouts, are the same
   men who speak and write against Socialism.</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">They say that Socialists want to get up a
   revolution, to turn, the country upside down by force, to seize
   all property, and to divide it equally amongst the whole
   people.</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">But today, there are very few Socialists who
   believe in brute force, or who think a revolution possible or
   desirable.</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">I have always been dead against the idea of
   revolution, for many reasons. I do not think a revolution is
   possible in Britain. Firstly, because the people have too much
   sense; secondly, because the people are by nature patient and
   kindly; thirdly, because the people are too free to make force
   needful.</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">Revolution by force of arms is not desirable
   or feasible; but there is another kind of revolution from which we
   hope great things. This is a revolution of thought. Let us once
   get the people, or the big majority of the people, to understand
   Socialism, to believe in Socialism, and to work for Socialism, and
   the real revolution is accomplished.</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">As to seizing the wealth of the country and
   sharing it out amongst the people. First, we do not propose to
   seize anything. We do propose to get some things, the land, for
   instance, and to make them the property of the whole nation but we
   mean that to be done by Act of Parliament and by purchase. second,
   we have no idea of "sharing out" the land' nor the railways, nor
   the money, nor any other kind of wealth; property, equally amongst
   the people. To share these things out, if they could be shared,
   which they could not be, would be to make them private property,
   whereas we want them to be public property, the property of the
   British nation.</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">Make all men equal in possessions," cry the
   Non-Socialist, "and in a very short time there would be rich and
   poor, as before."</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">It is quite true that, did we divide all
   wealth equally tomorrow, there would in a short time be many
   penniless, and a few in a way of getting rich; but it is only true
   if we suppose that after the sharing we allowed private ownership
   of land and the old system of trade and competition to go on as
   before. Change those things: do away with the land system which
   leads to poverty and to wealth, and we should have no more rich
   and poor.</font></dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd><center><font color="#0033FF" size="+1"><b>Now, dear friends,
   suppose that Socialism is established, </b></font></center></dd>
   
   <dd><center><font color="#0033FF" size="+1"><b>will the three main
   lines of argument in its faviour be satisfactorily met?
   </b></font></center></dd>
   
   <dd><center><font color="#0033FF" size="+1"><b>You remember the
   three arguments in faviour of Socialism: </b></font></center></dd>
   
   <dd><center><font color="#0033FF" size="+1"><b>Justice, Economy,
   Necessity. </b></font></center></dd>
</dl>

<p><font size="+1">1. What about</font></p>

<center><font color="#000099" size="+2"><b>The Argument From
Justice?</b></font></center>

<p><font size="+1">Socialists say: "It is not right that some should
be born with a claim to the good things of life, and others to
poverty or worse with little hope of betterment. Let all men start
alike in opportunity."</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">But is it possible to arrange social conditions
that all men may start alike in opportunity? The answer is
undoubtedly in the negative; for people are born with natural
differences which it is not in the power of man to adjust. In health,
in physical capabilities, and in mental ability the differences are
such, that those naturally favored would soon gain advantage over
their fellows. There are also differences in morals, and this is the
chief difficulty with which Socialism would have to contend. Some men
are good, honest, and trusting. There are others who endeavor to take
advantage of these and of one another, and to get the best of
everything, by honest means if they can, but if not, then by
dishonest means.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">But supposing that all were started alike in the
matter of wealth and position in life and in every other possible
respect, would it be possible to get lasting peace and contentment?
No. To ensure peace and contentment, which is the desire of all
nations, would necessitate that those in authority must be endowed
with such keen perceptions and accuracy of judgment, that they could
weigh and judge everything exactly, and be able to discern whether
any advantage some might gain was duly earned, and any loss that
others might suffer was truly deserved. More than that, these
officials would require to be possessed of unlimited powers, that
they might exercise their authority to the best advantage for the
community; and, finally, they would require to be so wise, loving and
just in all their words and actions, that the people would eventually
be perfectly satisfied and bow to their decisions.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">That would be a consummation to be desired, would
it not? If such conditions were established, then indeed the desire
of all nations would to a great extent be realized. But with human
nature as it is, how hopeless for us to expect so glorious a
consummation! Men have not that keenness of perception and accuracy
of judgment, which would enable them to fulfill the duties of such
unerring authorities; and even if some with more than ordinary acumen
were elected to office, the people, having tasted the sweets of
liberty and individual judgment, would not allow them to exercise
unlimited power. Indeed, it would be necessary for the officials to
be in an unassailable position, that they might successfully defy the
will of the people should occasion demand. This, however, would not
be a Socialist government.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">With human nature as it is, acts of injustice
would be inevitable on the part of the authorities, some of them
intentional due to moral obliquity, some of them unintentional due to
lack of judgment, thoughtlessness, or carelessness. The result would
be much grumbling and discontent. No board of officials, however well
intentioned, could satisfy all, or even the majority. The people
would eventually break away from restraint, and anarchy would
certainly follow.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">2. Let us now consider</font></p>

<center><font color="#000099" size="+2"><b>The Argument From
Economy.</b></font></center>

<p><font size="+1">Under this head there are four main difficulties
in the d'~culty of organization. Efficiency would require one way of
Socialism proving successful. </font></p>

<dl>
   <dd><font size="+1">(a) There is the central government, with
   district councils for local affairs. To ensure harmonious working
   between these councils and the central government would be
   extremely difficult; and as great authority would necessarily
   require to be placed in the hands of a few, clever schemers would
   seek the~pro'ninent positions for the sake of the power they could
   wield. Once they obtained the power, the people would
   suffer.</font></dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">(b) There is the difficulty of supply. In
   order to deal out the various necessities of life, officials would
   require t6 be appointed; and these, eager to get through with
   their work, would chafe at the need of attending to individual
   peculiarities, and incline to shirk their duty. Hence the people
   would suffer from this cause also. How different it would be,
   however, if the officials in charge had perfect 'minds and perfect
   hearts.</font></dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">(c) Then there is the difficulty of employment
   Each individual would require to have employment suited to his
   capabilities. But sooner or later many would desire a change. They
   would say: "I am rather tired of this kind of work; I would like
   something different"; or: "I am tired of being in this place; I
   would like to go somewhere else." It would be impossible, however,
   to allow every individual to change his employment or locality as
   he pleased; for this would certainly mean an over supply of
   laborers in favorable positions and districts, and inconvenient
   scarcity in the unfavorable. Hence, the people would require to be
   forced, more or less against their wills, to remain where they
   were placed; and discontent and trouble must be the
   outcome.</font></dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">(d) Lastly, there is the question of wages.
   Some suggest that money should not be used to pay wages. But the
   people must get food and clothing, etc., which would be a form of
   wage. Either all would receive alike, or else, if graded, the
   wages would be more or less at the discretion of the officials in
   charge. Suppose everyone received alike, what would be the result?
   Those with ability would lack the incentive of greater
   remuneration to put forth the best fforts; and the majority, who
   are without special ability, would attend their work only because
   obliged to. (This is what obtains in some measure at the present
   time, where Trades Unions insist on a minimum standard rate of
   wages.) I am speaking of the natural inclinations of men in
   general. There would certainly be noble exceptions; some who loved
   their work for its own sake, or who were conscientious and
   unselfish and worked for the sake of others. But we have no reason
   to suppose that there would be many of this class; and if it is
   claimed that the new Socialistic conditions would multiply such
   noble examples, peace and contentment could not reign so long as
   even a minority of the other class existed.</font></dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">If, on the other hand, the wages were graded,
   would not that delegate a great deal of power to the officials?
   What an amount of wire-pulling there would be to obtain the best
   situations! It would be impossible to prevent many of the evils of
   the present competitive system. Those in authority would require
   to be perfect both in mind and heart; but even if they were, do
   you think the people should be satisfied? Generally, those who are
   discontented and cause trouble, are the indolent and
   incompetent.</font></dd>
</dl>

<p><font size="+1">3. As regards the third argument,</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center><font color="#000099" size="+2"><b>The Argument From
Necessity</b></font></center>

<p><font size="+1">Much might be done to alleviate present
conditions; but to remove all the social, physical, mental, and moral
imperfections which abound. is beyond the power of man.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">And so we see, dear friends, that whether
Socialism will, or will not ultimately be established, there is
certain to be trouble in the near future. The people are rapidly
wakening out of their mental lethargy, and their superstitious
reverence for kings, aristocracy, and church. They see that while
they have not their fair share of this world's goods, others are
rolling in luxury. Their natural appetites and desires prevent them
from agreeing that a bare existence is all that is necessary. They
know that happiness is needful to make existence desirable. In the
meantime, some form of Socialism is the only remedy which seems to
offer relief.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">All men recognise the signs of unrest everywhere
manifest. Many console themselves with the thought that the nations
are passing through a period of transition, but that though
experiencing some changes perhaps, peace will ultimately be attained,
and the world will continue essentially as before. This is a delusive
hope, for whether Socialism is established or not, anarchy is bound
to ensue. If the people are thwarted, they will not rest content till
all the present kingdoms and institutions are shattered. The giant is
now too wide awake to permit himself again to be put into bondage.
If, on the other hand, Socialism is established, there will require
to be armies of public employees, and the individual will sooner or
later become the slave of officials even more than at present he is
the slave of the wealthy. Politics will be still more of a trade than
it is now. Rings and general corruption will be the order of the day.
With human nature as it is, force will be necessary to carry out the
various measures intended for the public good; and the people, having
once tasted the sweets of liberty, and finding their aspirations and
desires for freedom and happiness frustrated, will break away from
all restraints, and anarchy must follow.</font></p>

<p>* The trouble here referred to by the late Professor Edgar (who
died in June, 1910), is not the present (1915) great European war but
the more terrible civil strifes which will follow. Because of the
apparent evidences of the Scriptures, Professor Edgar consistently
proclaimed his belief that great trouble among the nations was due to
break out in Autumn1 1914, the date indicated by the prophetic period
named the "Seven Times of the Gentiles".</p>

<p><font size="+1">Is there any hope, then, of deliverance from the
distressing chaos into which the world is about to be plunged? Is
there any truth in the old adage that man's extremity is God's
opportunity? If there is a God above, He will foreknow all things. He
must surely have revealed in His Word sufficient to help and sustain
those who believe on Him, in order that they may intelligently
co-operate in the means which He will have directed for the good of
man.</font></p>

Followed by</b></font>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+2"><b>World-Wide
Blessing.</b></font></p></center>

<p><font size="+1">There are many Scriptures which teach that, in
God's order, the world must first pass through the great fire of
trouble before they can hope to have their desire of good government,
peace and contentment realised.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">This thought is expressed in our text, Haggai
2:6,7 "</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>For thus saith the
Lord of hosts, Yet once it is a little while, and I will shake all
nations; and the desire of all nations shall
come.</b></font><font size="+1">" And in Zeplianiah 3:8,9
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>Therefore wait ye upon me,
saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my
determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the
kingdoms</b></font><font size="+1">" that is what is taking place
now; we find that all the kingdoms are associating together against
their common enemy, the people. The Lord goes on to say why He has
determined to gather the nations and assemble the kingdoms. It is to
pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all
the earth shall be devoured by the fire of my jealousy. For then will
I turn to the people a <i>pure language</i>, that they may all call
upon the name of the Lord to serve Him with one consent.'</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Turn next to the <b>12th chapter of Daniel</b>.
There we see in the 4th verse regarding "the time of the end"
[the time of the end of the present kingdoms, the time of the end
of the present reign of evil] that
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>many shall run to and fro,
and knowledge shall be increased.</b></font><font size="+1">" We know
from history that this prophecy never was fulfilled in the past; but
when we look around us and consider our modern locomotives,
steamships and motor cars, our schools, technical colleges and free
libraries, etc., we cannot doubt that we are even now witnessing the
fulfilment of the prophecy. !t is evident that we are now living in
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>the time of the
end.</b></font><font size="+1">"</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">In the first and second verses of the chapter, we
read:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>And at
that time shall Michaelstand up, the great prince which standeth for
the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble such
as never was since there was a nation even to that same
time.</b></font><font size="+1">" Our Lord In quoting these words in
the 24th chapter of Matthew, 21st verse, says:
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>For then shall be great
tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this
time, no, nor ever shall be
[again].</b></font><font size="+1">" The coming trouble is to
be greater than was even the French Revolution, though that was very
terrible. It will be the greatest time of trouble that has ever taken
place, or ever will take place, in the history of the
world.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Why will the Lord require to bring the world
through such severe trouble? In the book of Proverbs (XVIII, 14) we
are told: "</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>The spirit of a
man will sustain his infirmity, but a wounded spirit who can
bear?</b></font><font size="+1">" So long as a man can keep up his
spirit, it does not matter how weak he may be, he is more or less
self-reliant; but once his spirit is</font> <font size="+1">broken,
all the stamina is taken out of him, and he is helpless. In the
present, as in the past, men think that by their own efforts they
will bring about the desire of all nations. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The Socialists say: </font></p>

<center><font size="+1"><b>"Just let Socialism get into full swing,
and we shall soon renovate the whole earth."</b> </font></center>

<p><font size="+1">The Anti-socialists say: </font></p>

<dl>
   <dd><center><font size="+1"><b>"Let us alone. We shall bring about
   reforms gradually. </b></font></center></dd>
   
   <dd><center><font size="+1"><b>Only be patient and by-and-by there
   will be peace and contentment throughout the
   world."</b></font></center></dd>
</dl>

<p><font size="+1">The spirits of both parties will require to be
broken in order to teach them the fully of self-reliance; and to this
end the Lord will bring them through the great trouble, as He has
foretold by His holy prophets. When it is over, men will acknowledge
their own helplessness and their need of a Saviour. They will turn to
God and implore His aid; and, His name be praised, the Lord will help
the helpless. "</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>The Lord is
nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a
contrite spirit.</b></font><font size="+1">"</font>
<font size="+1">Psalm 34:13.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thus we see that the Scriptures corroborate what
we have observed from the signs of the times, namely, that there is
to be world-wide anarchy at an early date. Let us now enquire of the
Word of God:</font>&nbsp;</p>

<center><font color="#000099" size="+2"><b>Who Will Bring About the
Desire of</b></font>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+2"><b>All
Nations?</b></font></p></center>

<p><font size="+1">It is Important to notice that in the Scriptures
alone is there an indication of hope for the world escaping out of
the dreadful conditions which will shortly prevail; and the
Scriptures were written by Jews for the Jewish nation. When,
therefore, Christ comes again to take His great power, He will reign
as "</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>King of the
Jews,</b></font><font size="+1">" and the Jewish nation will be the
foremost at that time. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">As Jesus said, </font></p>

<center><font size="+1">"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>Salvation
is of the Jews.</b></font><font size="+1">" </font></center>

<p><font size="+1">The other nations will</font>
<font size="+1">gradually be merged into the Jewish nation, so that
all will ultimately have the one great King, who will rule over and
bless them, and so bring about everlasting peace and contentment,
"the desire of all nations."</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">There are many passages of Scripture which
prophesy that after the kingdoms of this Dispensation are overthrown,
Christ will reign with an autocratic rule upon the earth. I shall
briefly refer to a few of these prophecies.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Daniel 12;1 says that
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>at that
time</b></font><font size="+1"> [the time of the end]
</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>Michael shall stand
up.</b></font><font size="+1">" The word Michael means
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>One like unto
God</b></font><font size="+1">"; and can only refer to Jesus Christ,
the one who is the express image of the Father. He is the great
Prince which stands for Daniel's people, the Israelites; and Daniel
was told that when He manifests His power on their behalf,
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>at that time thy people
shall be delivered.</b></font><font size="+1">" The Jews have been
persecuted all through this Gospel Age, but they will soon cease to
be "</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>trodden down of the
Gentiles,</b></font><font size="+1">" and God will return His favour
to them, and they shall be His chosen people. We see this beginning
even now. Palestine is being opened up, and the Jews are fast
returning to their native land; they are also now opening their ears
to the comforting words of Isaiah 40, verses 1 and 2; but it is not
the due time for their complete return of favour.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The prophecy continues:
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>And many of them that
sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life,
and some to shame and everlasting
contempt.</b></font><font size="+1">" When Christ's Kingdom is set up
on the ruins of the present kingdoms after the time of trouble, and
the Jews return to their own land and to God's favour, the general
resurrection of the dead will take place. This is also shown in
Revelation11:18, which reads:
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>And the nations were
angry, and thy wrath is come</b></font><font size="+1">" there is to
be world-wide trouble among the nations, due to the wrath of God,
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>and the time of the dead,
that they should be judged,</b></font><font size="+1">"-the awakening
of the dead is to take place at the same
time,-"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>and that thou
shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the
saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest
destroy them that destroy the
earth.</b></font><font size="+1">"</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">During that long period known as the "times of the
Genti1es," the Jewish nation has been trodden under by the Gentile
kingdoms. This was foretold by Ezekiel, who, as the prophetic
mouthpiece of the Lord, said to Zedekiah, the last king of Judah:
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>And thou, profane wicked
Prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end,
thus saith the Lord God; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown:
this shall not be the same; exalt him that is
low</b></font><font size="+1"> [the Gentiles],
</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>and abase him that is
high</b></font><font size="+1"> [Israel].
</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>I will overturn, overturn,
overturn, it</b></font><font size="+1"> [the kingdom of
Israel]; </font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>and it shall
be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it
him</b></font><font size="+1">"</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Ezekiel 21:25-27. The kingdom of Israel was the
kingdom of God; its kings were always spoken of as sitting upon the
throne of the Lord. Consequently when the crown was removed from the
king of Judah, God's kingdom upon earth ceased.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">In this prophecy the Lord declared that His
kingdom would be no more until one came whose right it is. In the
interim of waiting, the Gentiles, who were
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>aliens from the
commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenant of promise,
having no hope and without God in the
world</b></font><font size="+1">" (Ephesians 2:12), were exalted to
hold the dominion of the world; but when the "times of the Gentiles"
have expired (Luke 21:24), He whose right it is will take to Himself
His great power and reign. Who is this? Undoubtedly it is our Lord
Jesus Christ, the greater Son of David. How did He acquire the right
to God's kingdom upon earth? He gained it by His voluntary death on
the cross. "</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>Ye are not your
own, for ye are bought with a price.</b></font><font size="+1">" "For
to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be
the Lord both of the dead and living" First Corinthians 6:19, 20;
Romans 14:9.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The same great truth is taught in Daniel II,
31-45, where</font> <font size="+1">it shows how the successive
Gentile nations, which have held universal sway since the overthrow
of the kingdom of Israel, were symbolised by a great image seen
by</font> <font size="+1">Nebuchadnezzar in a dream. The head of this
image was of gold and represented Babylonia; its breasts and arms of
silver, Medo-Persia; its belly and thighs of brass, Greece; its legs
of iron, Pagan Rome; its feet of iron and clay, Papal Rome; and its
toes, the present divisions of the Roman Empire.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">In the dream, this image was smitten on the feet
by a little stone cut out without hands, and was demolished into dust
and scattered till no place was found for it. The stone then grew
into a great mountain which filled the whole earth. Daniel explains
that this great mountain which will fill the whole earth is the
Kingdom of our Lord. The seventh chapter of Daniel refers to the same
four universal Empires under the figure of four beasts, and describes
how one like the Son of man, together with the saints of the most
High, comes with the clouds of heaven to take possession of the
kingdom.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">In Micah 4:8, the Lord Jesus is spoken of as the
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>Tower of the
flock</b></font><font size="+1">"
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>And thou, 0 tower of the
flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it
come, even the first dominion.</b></font><font size="+1">" The first
dominion, which was granted to Adam, and subsequently to Israel, is
His by right; and soon He will shatter the present kingdoms, and take
the dominion to Himself. At the same time, as we have seen, He will
cause the Jews to return to their own land and to the favour of God,
and will bring about the resurrection of the dead.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Before considering the method by which Christ's
rule will bring about the desire of all nations, which man's rule has
failed to accomplish, let us see what are</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center><font color="#000099" size="+2"><b>The Fundamental Reasons of
Man's</b></font>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+2"><b>Failure to
Govern.</b></font></p></center>

<dl>
   <dd><font size="+1"><b>1</b>. The first and chief reason is that
   men are sinners, not saints, and this not through any individual
   fault of their own, but through heredity and environment.
   "</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>There is none
   righteous, no, not one. There is none that
   doeth</b></font><font color="#660099"><b>
   </b></font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>good.</b></font><font size="+1">"
   Selfishness prevails instead of love. The world, the flesh, and
   the devil are too strong for men, however well intentioned they
   may be, unless God is on their side. Even the Communism of the
   saints in the time of the Apostles, failed from this very cause
   (Acts 4:34-37; 6:1); and if such men and women failed, how
   certainly will the world at large fail! Sin and selfishness must
   be eradicated before men are capable of successfully ruling
   themselves or others. This reason may be named the imperfect moral
   nature of man, due mainly to heredity and environment. <b>His
   heart is not right.</b></font></dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd><font size="+1"><b>2</b>. A second important reason is, that
   no one, ruler or subject, is perfectly sound in mind.. We confine
   a certain section of mankind in asylums and label them "insane."
   As a matter of fact, however, there is no one perfectly sane or
   sound of mind. What is insanity? Insanity simply means lack of
   judgment; and I do not think anyone will claim that he is
   perfectly sound (sane) in judgment. However wisely a man or a body
   of men may rule, occasional errors in judgment are sure to occur.
   The principal reason for this is the inability to read motives.
   Men can judge only by the hearing of the ear, and the seeing of
   the eye; they cannot read the heart. Thus "to err is human" has
   become a proverb. This reason of man's failure to govern
   successfully may be called the imperfect mental nature of man, due
   mainly to heredity. <b>His head is not right</b>.</font></dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd><font size="+1"><b>3</b>. A third reason, no less important
   than the others, is that everyone is more or less physically
   imperfect. Some are a little stronger than their fellows, but all
   are more or less weak and prone to disease and accidents, and
   sooner or later everyone goes down into death. So long as death
   reigns, there can never be everlasting peace and contentment.
   Though every other cause of sorrow were removed, the loss by death
   of our nearest and dearest, and the knowledge that sooner or later
   we also will require to die, must necessarily mar happiness. This
   reason may be called the</font> i<font size="+1">mperfect physical
   nature of man. Like the other two, it is mainly due to heredity.
   <b>His body is not right.</b></font></dd>
</dl>

<p><font size="+1">Thus, moral imperfection, mental imperfection, and
physical imperfection ending in death, will require to be removed
before the desire of all nations can come. Men have been constantly
endeavouring to remove these imperfections and to improve their
environment, but without success. Christ alone is able to accomplish
this great work; and we are assured in the Scriptures that He will do
so; it is for this purpose that He comes again.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center><font color="#000099" size="+2"><b>The Cause of the Present
Imperfection.</b></font></center>

<p><font size="+1">What is the cause of the fact that all men are
more or less imperfect mentally, physically, and morally? Cleariy for
the most part, their frailty is due to heredity. Some say: It is all
very well to blame heredity, but a man's imperfections are due to his
own fault. While this is true, it is so only to a small extent. No
children are born physically perfect; some are disfigured with gross
deformities. The same is true of the mental condition; and as regards
the moral nature, you have not exercised your powers of observation,
if you have not noticed the evidences of moral imperfection in
children even before they are able to reason. The man who denies the
influence of heredity is mentally blind. The Scriptures are in entire
accordance with all this. The Psalmist says that we are born in sin,
and shapen in iniquity, Psalm 51:5; see also Job 14:4.
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>The fathers have eaten a
sour grape </b></font><font color="#000000" size="+1">[of
sin]</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b> and the children's
teeth are set on edge </b></font><font size="+1">" Jeremiah</font>
<font size="+1">31:29.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">As it is evident that we are all imperfect, and
therefore all sinners, mainly through the law of heredity, it is
necessary to inquire: How did sin enter into world? If we trace the
law of heredity backwards, we come to the first</font>
<font size="+1">man. Is it that the first man, as the Evolution
theory claims, was only a little removed above the ape and,
therefore, with most of the mental and moral infirmities</font>
<font size="+1">of the brute? If so, then God is the author of sin.
Reason and the Word of God both declare the falsity of such a
view.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">But the Bible account is not that man was made in
the image of the ape nor a little above the ape, but that he was made
in the image of God (Genesis 1:27), a little lower than the angels,
Hebrews 2:6,7. All God's works are perfect, Deuteronomy 32:4.
According to the Scriptures, then, man was perfect in the beginning
and through sin fell from this perfection. I have heard some
argue:</font></p>

<center><font size="+1"><b>"If Adam was perfect, how could he
sin?"</b></font></center>

<p><font size="+1"> The reply is that, he was not created with a
fully developed character; his perfection implied perfect mental and
moral faculties in a perfect body. His character was a blank; but God
implanted in him a conscience or moral sense, that is, the faculty or
power of discerning between right and wrong, to enable him to form
character. Adam was also allowed the liberty of his will, in order
that he might be free to choose good or evil, and so develop a good
or wicked character.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Some think that God should have created Adam so
that he could not sin, and thus have avoided all this misery and
sickness and death which we see around us, and which every one of us
experience. Was it not wrong for God, they ask, to permit Adam to
sin? God cannot do wrong. To have created man without freedom of
will, would have made him a mere machine. God purposed to bring an
earthly being into existence who would love Him spontaneously; and
who would worship Him in spirit and truth, John 4:23. Man had nothing
whatever to do with the formation of his body and brain; that was his
Creator's work. It is character which decides destiny, and it is the
formation of character that God has left in out hands, as we read:
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>Keep thy heart with all
diligence, for out of it are the issues of
life</b></font><font size="+1">", Proverbs 4:23.</font></p>

<center><font size="+1"><b>According to the Scriptures, Adam chose
the wrong course, First Timothy 2:4. Was God taken by
surprise?</b></font></center>

<p><font size="+1">Not at all. He had His plan of redemption arranged
from the beginning, for
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>known unto God are all his
works from the beginning of the world</b></font><font size="+1">",
Acts 15:18 He had foreordained from before the foundation of the
world that the "Lamb" should be slain, First Peter 1:18-20. God
sentenced Adam to death; and by the law of heredity which He brought
into operation, all the descendants of the first man have been born
in sin, and share the sentence to death with him, as it is written:
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>As by one man sin entered
into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men,
for that all have sinned</b></font><font size="+1">", Romans
5:12.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center><font color="#000099" size="+2"><b>The Satisfaction of
Justice.</b></font></center>

<p><font size="+1">The foregoing shows the stern justice of God; but
the Scriptures declare that
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>God is
love.</b></font><font size="+1">" Let us now, therefore, consider
evidences of His love, that true love which is both wise and just.
God, having condemned all in Adam, in due time sent His only-begotten
Son into the world in order that He might become Adam's substitute,
and take upon Himself the death penalty. First, however, the Lord
allowed an interval to elapse, because He foresaw it would be
necessary to prove to men their need of a Saviour. If God had sent
Jesus Christ sooner, it would always have been open to question
whether men could not have saved themselves; but by the inethod which
He adopted, it was proven conclusively that
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>none of them by any means
can redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for
him</b></font><font size="+1">", Psalm 49:7, that
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>there is none righteous,
no, not one</b></font><font size="+1">", Romans 3:10. To satisfy
perfect justice which demands an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,
a life for a life, the ransom price to be paid must be an exact
equivalent, namely, the life of a perfect man. This man would require
to be absolutely without sin, because justice demands a sinner's
death. No descendant of Adam has been born free from sin; nor has any
since merited life in his own right in order that he might lay it
down in sacrifice as a ransom or corresponding price for</font>
<font size="+1">Adam, neither the Jew who had the written law to
guide him, nor the Gentile who had the light of his conscience and
reason as a guide. Even the angels, whom the Scriptures indicate were
permitted by God to attempt the uplift of man during the first
Dispensation before the flood, were unable to reverse the sentence of
death passed upon the human race. On the contrary, instead of raising
men from sin and degradation, many of the angels fell from their
first estate, as we read in Jude 6.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thus God demonstrated that His way of salvation is
the only possible way. His only begotten Son, Jesus Himself, left the
glory He had with His Father in heaven, and partook of flesh and
blood that He might die as a man; that through death He might destroy
him that has the power of death, that is, the devil, Hebrews 2:9,14.
It was love that dictated the sacrifice, and He obeyed the dictates
of love. As Jesus has paid the price, the first man will in due time
be set free, that he may have a second opportunity for life or death.
But not only will Adam be set free from the prison-house of death,
but the whole race also, which was condemned in him. That is what
Paul declares in Romans 5:18,I9,
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>As by the offence of one,
judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the
righteousness of one the free gift shall come upon all men to
justification of life. For as by one man's disobedience many were
made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made
righteous.</b></font><font size="+1">"</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center><font color="#000099" size="+2"><b>The Reign of
Christ.</b></font></center>

<p><font size="+1">When Christ begins His glorious reign, he will
destroy the works of the devil, First John 3:8. These works are Sin
and Death, with all that these imply. First Corinthians 15:25, 26,
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1">For he

of mankind that obstruct the establishment of good government, peace
and contentment? They are <b>moral imperfection, mental</b></font><b>
</b><font size="+1"><b>infperfection, and physical imperfection</b>.
These result from sin and end in death, and must be put under Christ'
feet before the desire of all nations can be realised.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">In the book of Revelation 21:I,2, we are assured
that the first enemy that Chnst will subdue will be Satan. As the
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>prince of the power of the
air</b></font><font size="+1">" Satan now rules in the hearts of the
children of disobedience, and as the
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>god of this
world</b></font><font size="+1">" he
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>hath blinded the minds of

Christ, who is the image of God, should shine ulito
them</b></font><font size="+1">"</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Ephesians 2:3; Second Corinthians 4:4. Satan is
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>the prince of this
world</b></font><font size="+1">" John 14:30, and must be deposed;
then Christ will become the Prince of Peace. Satan will be bound for
a thousand years, to prevent him deceiving the nations during their
process of uplifting under the beneficent rule of Christ. But when
the thousand years ate expired he must be loosed for a little season,
in order to finally test the loyalty of the people to God and to
righteousness. When all the enemies of God and righteousness have
been destroyed, then, indeed, the desire of all nations will have
come. That glorious condition, however, will not exist till the end
of Christ's Millennial reign.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">During the thousand years of Christ's rule, the
moral, mental and physical imperfections which have rendered man.
helpless in his attempt to govern the world, will be removed. Of the
three, the condition of the heart is the most important. Will men's
heart's be put right? Yes. In Ezekiel 36:26,27, we read:
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>A new heart also will I
give you, and a new spirit will I put within
you:</b></font><font color="#660099"><b>
</b></font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>and I will take away
the stony heart out of your flesh, and will give you a heart of
flesh. And I will put my spiril within you, and cause you to walk in
my statutes, and you shall keep my judgments, and do
them.</b></font><font size="+1">" Through the prophet Jeremiah
31:28,29, we are informed that the law of heredity will cease after
the Israelites are restored to their land and to God's everlasting
favour "</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>And it shall come
to pass, that like as I have
watched</b></font><font color="#660099"><b>
</b></font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>over them to pluck up,
and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict:
so will I watch over them, to build and to plant, saith the Lord. In
those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour
grape, and the children's teeth are set on
edge.</b></font><font size="+1">" This means that in those days,
i.e., during Christ's Millennial reign, no man will suffer mentally,
morally, or physically through heredity.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">How will this change be accomplished? Simply by
bringing in a new order of things, a new Dispensation. Those in the
grave will come forth, and those who survive the great time of
trouble which will bring the present Dispensation to a close, will
live on. There will be no births as we have now, because so long as
procreation continues, the law of heredity will operate. Jesus
Himself said: "</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>In the
resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in
marriage</b></font><font size="+1">", Matthew 22:30. The prophet goes
on to declare, Jeremiah 31:30,
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>But everyone
</b></font><font size="+1">[who dies]<b>
</b></font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>shall die for his own
iniquity: every man that eateth the sour
grape</b></font><font size="+1"> [of
sin]</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>, his teeth shall
be set on edge.</b></font><font size="+1">" Each one will suffer, or
die, for his own individual misdeeds. This is in accordance with the
Apostle's statement, recorded in Acts 3:23,
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>Every soul which will Dot
hear that prophet </b></font><font size="+1">[in the sense of
obeying him]</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b> shall be
destroyed from among the people.</b></font><font size="+1">" The
Psalmist also declares 72:9,
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>His enemies shall lick the
dust.</b></font><font size="+1">"</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">But the extreme penalty of death will be only for
wilful persistent disobedience. There will not be any at that time
who will be ignorant of God's glorious character, and His wonderful
plan of salvation. "</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>Behold
the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new cove~ant with
th~ house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: After those days,
saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it

chapter of Isaiah, we read regarding the reign of Christ, the time
when the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose:
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>Then the eyes of the blind
shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then
shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing:

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center><font color="#000099" size="+2"><b>The Resurrection of the
Unjust.</b></font></center>

<p><font size="+1">Thus the testimony of God's Word, dear friends, is
that all moral, mental, and physical imperfections will be removed by
Christ, not suddenly, but gradually. With the exception of the
saints, who have died in faith, everyone will be raised from the
grave with the same imperfect character such as he has now. If a man
is vicious in this life-time he will be raised with the same vicious
character. Moderately good men will rise moderately good. It will not
profit anyone to say: "I am to get another chance. I will do as I
like now." Solomon, speaking to such, said:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>Rejoice,
0 young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days
of thy youth,~and walk in the ways of thine beart, and in the sight
of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will
bring thee into judgment</b></font><font size="+1">", Ecclesiastes
11:9.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">In the resurrection, just as it is now, the
development of character will be gradual. In the present
Dispensation, evil is permitted by God and is prospering.
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>Now we call the proud
happy: yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that
tempt God are even delivered</b></font><font size="+1">", Malachi
3:15. The consequence is that the people are pursuing the downward
course of sin; for it is apparent to every right thinking man that
the world, left to itself, is not learning righteousness.
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>Because sentence agatnst
an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the
hearts</b></font><font color="#660099"><b>
</b></font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>of the sons of men is
fully set in them to do evil</b></font><font size="+1">",
Ecclesiastes 13:11. Business men dleclare that there is dishonesty in
all commercial concerns; that no business can succeed on lines of
strict integrity. In these times it is much more difficult to do good
than to do evil. Frequently when you do a kindly action for anyone,
you do not even get thanks; and if you are gentle and loving, people
think you soft and try to take advantage of you. If you endeavour to
lead an honest, straightforward life, you are certain to meet with
opposition. "</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>All that will
live godly in Jesus Christ shall suffer
persecution</b></font><font size="+1">", First Timothy 3:12. The
development of good character in the present time meets with
opposition at every turn. Need we wonder at this when Satan is the
god of this world, the prince of the power of the air?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It will be very different when Christ takes His
power to reign. He will judge the people with righteousness, and evil
will no longer be permitted. Of that time we read:</font></p>

<center><font size="+1">"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>When
the judgments of the Lord are in the earth, the inhabitants of the
world will learn righteousness</b></font><font size="+1">",
</font></center>

<p><font size="+1">Isaiah 26:9. When Christ is reigning, every time a
man sins the penalty will follow swiftly and surely, and, on the
other hand, every time a man does a righteous act he will be rewarded
immedi tely. Thus the righteous will be encouraged, and the sinner
will be discouraged; the people will soon find that it will pay to do
good; that the better they are the more they succeed, and the worse
they are the greater they suffer, the very reverse of what obtains at
present. The inhabitants of the world will then learn righteousness,
and will flourish (Psalm 72:7); as their moral imperfection
disappears, their mental and physical imperfections will also
disappear, until finally they will attain to that perfection lost by
Adam.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center><font color="#000099" size="+2"><b>Christ's Reign
Autocratic.</b></font></center>

<p><font size="+1">At first, the people will require to be forced to
obey but the necessary pumshment will be of a reformative</font>
<font size="+1">nature, and will be accompanied by evidences of love
and impartial justice. Everyone will recognize that any punishment he
may receive is deserved and intended for his good. He will have the
best guarantee that this is so, for the judge in that day will be the
meek and gentle Jesus, and associated with Him will be the saints,
(Acts 17:31; First Corinthians 6:2). Gradually the world will yield
that obedience which comes from love and appreciation of
righteousness, and will no longer require to be forced.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">In Christ's day errors in judgment will not occur,
nor mistakes of any kind on the part of the Great Judge.
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>There shall come forth a
rod Out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his
roots; and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of
wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit
of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord; and shall make him of quick
understanding in the fear of the Lord: and he shall not judge after
the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after ehe hearing of his
ears</b></font><font size="+1">", Isaiah 11:1-8.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">This chapter is one of the best known of these
which describe the Millennial reign of Christ. It describes how such
ferocious animals as the wolf, the leopard aod the lion will lie down
with the lamb and the kid, and how a little child shall lead them. It
tells, too, how "</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>they shall
not hurt nor destroy in all God's holy mountain; for the earth shall
be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the
sea.</b></font><font size="+1">" In that day Christ will see into the
hearts of men; and will discern the motives which underlie their
every thought and action.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Not only will Christ be unerring in judgment, and
His dealings ultimately recognised by all to be just and loving,
perfect, but His righteous decisions will be backed by the almighty
power of God. He has full authority from God to execute His wise,
just and loving purposes when the time comes. When He rose from the
dead, He said:</font></p>

<center><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>"All power is given unto
me in heaven and in earth"</b></font></center>

<p><font size="+1">Matthew 28:18, He will not require to consider,
whether His laws and judgments are popular or otherwise for He will
have no fear of an election or revolution by which He might be
unseated from power. His Kingdom will be an everlasting Kingdom; and
His authority will be absolute, for
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>he has been highly exalted
and given a name above every name.</b></font><font size="+1">" His
decisions will be so just and loving and wise, and will be executed
so effectually and with such good results, that ultimately every knee
shall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under
the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the
glory of God the Father-Philippians 2:10,11. Thus we see that
Christ's reign will be autocratic.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center><font color="#000099" size="+2"><b>The Desire of all Nations
shall come.</b></font></center>

<p><font size="+1">At the end of the thousand years, those who love
iniquity will be destroyed in the second death (Revelation 21:8); all
others will continue to live during the Ages to follow. Sin and
selfishness, and all forms of mental and physical imperfections will
be completely eradicated, and there will be
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>no more death, neither
sorrow, nor crying, neither will there be anymore pain, for the

perfect earth will be given to the human race under</font>
<font size="+1">God's sovreignty, because man will then be perfect
not</font> <font size="+1">only in body, but also in heart, in
character. They will</font> <font size="+1">have perfect communion

love the Lord their God with all their heart,</font>
<font size="+1">and mind, and soul and strength, and their neighbour

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center><font color="#000099" size="+2"><b>The Purpose of the Present
Dispensation.</b></font></center>

<p><font size="+1">I have dwelt principally on the hope which will be
offered to the world, and have not enlarged on the hope held out to
the Church, the followers of Christ. In closing, therefore, I would
urge upon you the desirability of believing in Christ now, and of
accepting the gracious privilege of becoming members of His Body,
(First Corinthians 12:12). If we follow in His footsteps now when
evil is permitted, we shall share in His resurrection, and shall be
associated with Him in His glorious reign. As we read:
"</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>It is a faithful saying:
For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him: if we
suffer, we shall also reign with him</b></font><font size="+1">",
Second Timothy 2:11,12. This will mean a life of self-denial and
sacrifice, doing good to all men as we have opportunity, but
especially to the household of faith. It will bring much persecution
and contradiction of sinners. But though we shall have tribulation,
the peace of God will rule in our hearts, and we shall have the joy
of the Lord. "</font><font color="#660099" size="+1"><b>Godliness
with contentment is great gain.</b></font><font size="+1">" I trust
that all of us who take up our cross and follow Jesus, will overcome
evil with good and endure to the end; that for the joy set before us
we shall endure the cross, and despise the shame, looking unto Jesus
the author and finisher of our faith. If we do, we shall be counted
as overcomers. Let us pray for one another that we may be faithful
unto death, so that we may obtain the crown of life, and be
privileged to share with the Lord Jesus in His glorious work of
realising the desire of all nations, </font></p>

<center><font size="+1"><b>peace on earth, and good will toward men
to the glory of God the Father. </b></font>
