<p><font size="+2">This picture is nonlinear because there is no
prescribed place to start looking. There is no set sequence to "read"
it. You are invited to inspect whatever part of it interests you and
continue with whatever sequence comes to mind. With linear speech or
text, to understand it fully, you must start at the beginning and
read forward to the end. Thus, this site will present charts,
pictures, drawings, maps, and other random access kinds of
material.</font></p></center>
