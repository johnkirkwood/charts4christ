<h3><center><font color="#006600" size="+2"><i>Feature Subject:
Restitution</i></font></center></h3>

<p><font size="+1">Several aspects of restitution will be examined in
this issue of His Kingdom Comes. What restitution is, why we look
forward to the "times of restitution",what we can expect before and
during these times, all based on the Bible and Bible study. First we
will examine what is being restored and thereby discover what
restitution is.</font></p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF" size="+1">Restitution; what is
it?</font></h3>

<p><font size="+1">Restitution is the return or the restoring of
something lost or removed. If you restore an automobile or a cabinet,
you bring it back to the condition that it had when it was new or the
condition that the designer intended. Here in
</font><font color="#CC0099" size="+1">Exodus
22:6</font><font size="+1"> restitution (payment) is required for the
damage caused by a fire gone out of control.
</font><font color="#660099" size="+1">"If fire break out, and catch
in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the
field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely
make restitution." </font><font color="#000000" size="+1">In
</font><font color="#CC0099" size="+1">Acts
3:21</font><font color="#000000" size="+1"> we find the key to the
sort of restitution we will consider here;</font><font size="+1">

until the <i>times of restitution of all things, which God hath
spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets</i> since the world

all things"</i></font><font color="#000000" size="+1"> God spoke of
through His prophet Isaiah. Here are some of the statements which

   <dd><font color="#CC0099" size="+1"><b>Romans
   5:18</b></font><font color="#000000" size="+1">
   </font><font color="#660099" size="+1">"Therefore as by the
   <i>offence of one</i> judgment came upon <i>all men</i> to
   condemnation; even so by the <i>righteousness of one</i> the free
   gift came upon <i>all men</i> unto justification of
   life.</font><font color="#000000" size="+1"> </font></dd>

</dl>

<p><font size="+1">Only one man has ever lived a completely righteous
life, Jesus. Adam had a chance to become righteous and failed in his
attempt. However, while Adam was making his attempt, his environment,
food, water, companions, yes, even all that he came into contact
with, was the best that God had to offer. Likewise, when God extends
His offer to </font><font color="#660099" size="+1">"<i>all
men</i>"</font><font size="+1"> to become righteous, God will present
to </font><font color="#660099" size="+1">"<i>all
men</i>"</font><font size="+1">,
the</font><font color="#000000" size="+1"> <b>environment</b> that He
formerly gave to Adam. This giving again, or restoring, of an
<b>environment conducive to righteousness</b>, is the "restitution"
that we are discussing. Our degraded environment has been killing us
since Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden. The Garden
of Eden <b>environmental conditions</b> are that which will be
restored. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="+1">The lack of good sustenance (food,
water and air), the lack of good education, the lack of good
companionship all keep us from righteousness. All of these will be
supplied when God restores the Garden of Eden conditions to the whole
Earth. Here are some thoughts on what was lost and that which will be
restored.</font></p>

   <dd><font color="#000000" size="+1">To me, this indicates that the
   weather in the garden of Eden was always warm, but not too warm,
   without rain or snow that would make Adam and Eve uncomfortable.
   Our future houses (</font><font color="#CC0099" size="+1">Isaiah

   these conditions by having no heating or cooling system.
   Therefore, with the absence of these power hungry systems, power
   generation could be done at the home site or at the community
   level making obsolete the megabusiness of central electric power
   generation, transportation and sales.</font></dd>

   eat:" </font><font color="#000000" size="+1">This indicates that
   any and all of the fruit that grew in the garden would sustain
   life, <b>perfect</b> <b>life</b>. What a joy it will be to pick
   your own delicious food from your own varied trees, 12 months of
   the year, and eat it on the spot or in the house. It also
   indicates that the megabusiness of food growing (on commercial
   farms), food packaging, food transporting and food selling will be
   obsolete and at an END when the restitution takes
   place.</font></li>

   it." </font><font color="#000000" size="+1">This indicates that

   him an help meet for him."
   </font><font color="#000000" size="+1">I think every human that
   has ever lived feels in their heart the need for companionship.
   Not just the presence of someone else, but the closeness of others
   who are "soul-mates"; who aspire to the same beautiful goals; who
   give love to all; who are loved by all; whose touch is at once
   electric and soothing. Even our good friends the animals hunger
   for some communication and the touch of us and each other. I think
   that when both we and they are perfected, we will learn the
   languages of the animals and tell them, in the simplest of forms,
   what wonderful provisions God, through Jesus, has laid up for the
   Earth. We will radiate a love and peaceableness that the animals
   can sense.</font></li>

   shall be my people</i>."
   </font><font color="#000000" size="+1">Adam and Eve, when they
   were perfect, and Jesus, had a relationship with God, their
   soul-mate in the sky, that had all the elements of a good human
   relationship, save that of touch perhaps. The restitution of that
   relationship to all people of Earth, may be the most wonderful
   blessing of all. This promise was made to
   "</font><font color="#660099" size="+1">the house of
   Israel</font><font color="#000000" size="+1">" and it might seem

   and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it."
   </font><font color="#000000" size="+1">Here, in Jacob's dream, we
   see a symbolic picture of the future relationship of those on the
   Earth and those in Heaven. A direct line of communication with
   those in charge to erase completely any doubt about what the
