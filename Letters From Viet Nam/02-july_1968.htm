<p><font size="+1">Fort Sam Houston, TX, 7 July 1968</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">This is a short letter to answer a few of your
questions. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">My service no. comes right after my name in the
address (US 56987155). I don't remember saying anything about saying
nothing.??? Our barracks are not air conditioned but the service
club, some classrooms, the cafeteria (not the mess hall) the PX and
the commissary are. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Keep me informed about Kappy as she travels - you
did in your letter which was good. Someone will have to pick up the
check if there is one. I think it is just a small one. hat book did
you send to Diane? Thanks for the invite to the Ensley's.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I wrote the Gilbertson boy &amp; told him the
price for the cycle and tire.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Keep the records clean &amp; be careful with the
turntable and you should have no trouble with the equipment.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Sorry about Dave - say hi to Reggie for
me.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">No time now to see the Hemisfair but after I get
into AIT I will be able to go. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We got top barracks 3 times last week so we had
post privileges this weekend. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">When I get the name of the people with the class,
I can in effect get a Sunday morning pass off post. This is kind of a
rare privilege so I am looking forward to it. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Things are tough but not really that bad. If you
(I) take the right attitude, you can get along all right. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">About the dryer - it is the motor bearings,
probably, that have given out. See Fernie for a new motor or
bearings.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am at the Service club now and must get back to
the barracks soon.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Much love</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Take care</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">John</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">PS, I need air mail stamps.</font></p>

Fort Sam Houston, TX, 14 July 1968</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">What is going on up there? I haven't heard from
anyone in a while. Before I forget, I want you to send me one copy of
a lot of "Do You Know", 'The Hell of the Bible", you know now on the
phone.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I spent this afternoon with - you would never have
guessed - Miss Dianna L Jacobs and Miss Fort Bragg, yes that is her
name. Dianna has the nicest personality but Fort is the prettiest.
Except for the sunburn, the swimming is fabulous. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Can't think of anything I didn't say on the
phone.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Much love</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">John</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have been very fortunate in this class - we have
had full post privileges for 4 out of 5 weeks, more than any other
class before and will have all anyone ever gets next weekend. That
will make it a record 5 out of 6. We have set records in written
tests, our practical work here, and our work at camp Bullis. We got
16.7 out of a possible 17 in map and compass navigation - the highest
ever. Class 23-B got no post at all and most classes not more than
one or two.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have committed myself to start LPC (Leader
Preparation Course) This coming Friday - there is no guarantee that I
will finish, but I will give it all I have. If I finish, it will mean
a position of Corporal (trainee) in AIT and possibly a promotion to
E-2 in AIT.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The last night at camp we had a night navagation
course (follow a set compass for a hike of 4 miles) in which we (our
group of 5) came in ahead of the last group by 30 minutes. There was
nothing to do but wait so we lay on the ground and looked at the
stars. The Milky Way was bright as were all the stars. Where are the
Pleades? I couldn't find them.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">My hands and arms are the shade of the sopt of
paper only brown.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have gone to a bible study class at the chapel
#3 at 8:30 sunday for 2 weeks. A very interesting and understanding
man leads the class in an intelligent discussion of why there is sin
at all.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Tell Aleta and Fred and every one hello for me,
especially Kappy.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Put more questions in your next letter so I can
think of what to write. It sounds like some beautiful things have
been happening there, nothing at all here. No - I will have to take
that back. Last night a bunch of us were walking down the street and
saw how beautiful the clouds were in the sunset. Someone said, "If
the Army could, they would paint it Olive Drab and stencil US ARMY on
it. It's just too good for trainees</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">May God be with you,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">love John </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">PS, Dont worry about the notice from the bank of
Idaho. I have already paib it if they got my letter.</font></p>
