Smooth flight. Will send card from Japan if possible.</font></p>

the sun. It's been a smooth flight with some interesting sights of
the tundra in Alaska and the Bearing Sea. Will write soon.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I arrived in Cam Rahn Bay about 2 AM Tuesday.
Stayed There about 30 hours and then left for An Khe. An Khe is where
I am now and it is hot, 90 to 110, but a breeze blows most of the
time. This is a training company to train us in jungle tactics of
some sort. I still don't know where I will be but it will be
somewhere here close to An Khe. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am fast running out of vitamins C and E and my
supply of vitamin A will last about a month or two. Please be
prepared to send some (one bottle) of 100 capsules of Setabaid mixed
tocopherols plus - available at the Spokane health food store. I will
send money as soon as possible. I will be making quite a bit more
money over here because it is all tax free. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I don't have an address worth using yet but I will
send one when I get one.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Say *HELLO* to Karen for me if I can't (no time).
Write soon.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">There are swimming facilities here so I hope I can
find time to take a dip now and then.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Don't write to the return address on this letter -
they say this is very important. If an emergency comes up, contact
the Red Cross.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Will write soon,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love John</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Here is some info on sending me packages while I
am here (Viet Nam).</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It's been three days since I slept on a sheet and
36 hours since I've seen a bed. I hope things will get better but my
duty last night (CQ Runner) from 7 PM to 7 AM was because I said I
couldn't go on guard duty because I was a conscientious objector -
the only one that that sergeant had ever seen.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Must write Donna, Diane and Marcia.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It's nice to have free paper envelopes and
postage. I don't have to arrange trips to the post office. I need
another small item, a Papermate Flair pen refill. Send one in a
letter when you can.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Our base got mortared 2 days ago at 2 AM. Perhaps
you saw in the paper the result - many large oil tanks here at An Khe
were burned. No one was killed or hurt here at the school.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I met a nice fellow whom I knew in Texas today -
just came into the school. By the way, this (my) class at this school
is the last one. What will be the next class will take the school
apart and ship it to the coast.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am writing this on a break between classes.
Across the way there is a monkey which is doing many funny
things.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">How is Aleta?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Will write more soon.</font></p>

An Khe, VN, 9 May 1969</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We got paid today. Also got told where we will be
assigned. I got; Co.D, 4th Bn, 50th (M) Infantry Div. This may not be
entirely correct so don't use it. The (M) stands for Mechanized so I
may not be walking.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Spread the money around on whatever is most
pressing. As of June you will get a check each month for $90.00,
$50.00 of this MUST go to The Bank of Troy as Payment on my loan. The
rest can go for vitamins and such, also postage on packages to me and
my bills ... hmmmmm ... Will send further instructions on gas co.
bills. Don't pay them out of the $40.00 unless I say to. Well,
anyway, put the rest where it is most needed. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">File the other things in this letter somewhere so
I can find them.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">This money thing is a drag!</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Next month (end of May) you will probably get
another $100.00, $25.00 of which (or however much the gas bills are)
will go to pay them (further instructions later).</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Send me vitamins E and C with the extra $5.00 this
month when you get an address.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">WHEW, What a mixed up letter. Hope you can get the
message.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am going to buy a camera (35 mm) the first of
next month. I can get a Pentax camera for about $125.00 so I think I
will. Anyway, I am going to send Ted Cowin the undeveloped film. Get
the slides from him (you may have to pay for the developing) and have
uncle John project them so you may see what RVN looks
like.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Sorry about the disjointed letter. Will do better
when my life gets unkinked.</font></p>

An Khe, VN, 16 May 1969 (LZ Uplift)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have asked again about calling on a MARS hookup
but I don't know how it will come out.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am finally at my permanent base out in the
sticks. The base is strictly military with no civilian houses or PX
here - However the base is quite big, maybe 500 to 800 people here,
maybe more. The food is as good as any in the military in the states
but you know how good that is. There are helicopters and APCs
(Armored Personnel Carriers) all over the place and large guns
emplaced all around.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">When I got here yesterday every one was sleeping
in a dirt floor tent. With some help from me, we got the new barracks
done enough to move into. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The barracks </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">is made </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">something </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">like this.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Since it never gets cool enough to be
uncomfortable, it is all that is needed. There is a lot of red dust
blowing around so if you (I) have a radio or something you have to
put it in a plastic bag to keep it from getting ruined. The average
maximum temperature during the day is 110 degrees F. and the average
minimum temperature during the night is about 65 degrees or
so.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Do write now and then so I will know what is going
on over there. About calling, there is a 10 hour difference from here
to you - if it is noon here it is 10 PM at home. Do also send cookies
with B vitamins and lethecin because I don't get any to speak of
here.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">See you next letter,</font></p>

An Khe, VN, 21 May 1969</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have done a couple of things worth noting since
I last wrote. We went to the beach at Qui Nhon (Quin Yon) Sunday and
swam and such and of course I got sun burned quite badly. I put PABA
on it three or four times and I don't think it is going to
peel.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Today we went to Phu Cat (Foo Kat). I bought some
film for my nonexistent camera, a gold cross on a necklace for
Donna's graduation and a thermos to keep water cold. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The rest of this letter is going to be addresses.
Put them in a safe place in case I lose my book or it gets
stolen.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">PS, I sent pictures of the beach to Erin. He will
give them to you if they turn out.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">

</font></p><hr><font size="+1">

An Khe, VN, 22 May 1969</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Got your letter today, the first one I received
over here.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I will send $60.00 June first or so - please send
some Plus brand mineral tablets (250) and I need some folic acid if
you can find some. Don't be too discouraged if you can't find any.
Adelle says it is almost impossible to get any.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The phone call situation is complicated and is
still pending, so don't expect too much.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I expected my old radio to give out from the way
it was sounding, but the one that Marcia gave me is still there. If
it has failed also, it probably just needs a battery. To fix the
piano situation, have Karen or Reggie drop over some time and work on
it or should I say play on it. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Send Rick's address when he gets one.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Have Vern stop by sometime on his way home and
look at the phonograph if the things I say here don't fix
it.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">1. Check the power cord to the turntable - it is
plugged into the back of the amplifier. THE AMPLIFIER MUST BE TURNED
ON TO GET JUICE TO THE TURNTABLE. To get at the back of the
amplifier, pull the amplifier out - careful it's heavy - while
feeding all the cords through the hole in the back of the cabinet.
You will notice the two outlets in the back of the amplifier, one
black and one red, one says "switched" one not. Check this out. If it
is unclear what is going on, just unplug the turntable from the
amplifier and pug it into the wall. NOTE: Don't set the amplifier
down on its front where the controls are. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">2. If the speed selector control is between two
speeds, it won't work. Check it out - it should click onto a speed
when pushed past.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">3. Make sure you are pulling the little vertical
lever lifting the arm to a position over the record and pushing the
main control to start. (manual)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">If all this fails call Vern.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The deposit slips are the one I wrote out and the
one they wrote out for the same deposit. OK I guess. Yes, send the
troy bank stuff here. If you need Vern's help, and the bill comes to
more than $9.00 or $11.00, send it to me. Otherwise, I hope the
$60.00 will cover it.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Do send some nourishing cookies over here - make
them tough and chewy so they will stand the shipping. It's rough. I
get hungry between meals when I don't eat all the cake cookies,
bread, etc. they have at the mess hall and there is nothing - I
repeat NOTHING worth eating at the PX.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Have the Carpathian Walnuts done anything? I hope
I get a letter from someone else also. </font></p>

</font></p><hr><font size="+1">

An Khe, VN, 28 May 1969 (LZ Uplift, in the field)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I was transferred to to field yesterday and sent
on an ambush patrol the first night. We got shot at, but the main
unit got all kids of things thrown at them; rockets, explosive
charges (satchel charges) bullets, etc. I don't like it here and it
doesn't seem right when the men all expect me to carry a weapon to
protect them. The officer said " when it comes to the place where you
are the last man, I expect you to pick up a weapon and shoot to
kill." So this is a non-combat position ... well I'll be darned.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have written to Brother Jolly and asked if there
is anything he can do. Is there anything that you can do? Like write
a congressman or something. The situation is very depressing - even
the food is enough to kill one.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Speaking of food, please send or have Anne and Don
send about 3 or 4 pounds of sunflower seeds and then the same amount
a week later. I will have a letter back to you by that time with
further instructions. I hope I can get out of this hole before too
long. I don't think I could stand 6 months or a year. It isn't the
grime, shooting and food so much, though it does add up, but the fact
that they SAID that I would NOT be in a combat position, which I
AM.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Tell Karen I pray for her and Aleta
same.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The man says he wants me to dig a fox hole so I
must go.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love John</font></p>

</font></p><hr><font size="+1">

An Khe, VN, 28 May 1969 (LZ Uplift, in the field)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am sure I am writing this to you by the grace of
God. Today we went on a foot patrol over to the villages by the lake
here. We searched through many houses finding mostly old men or women
and children or small children. The cruelty and belligerence shown by
our troops and the Viet Namese interpreters didn't swing any sympathy
to our side. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">When everything we did at that part of the place
seemed to draw a blank, the Lieutenant said to move on up the trail
and search out more houses (The last thing we did at the small group
of houses was to burn them. I remember well because I was inside
admiring the workmanship of the wood beam structure when someone
ignited the house). The column started down the trail with our
sergeant (Keith Janke) and a soul brother (Clarence Taylor) in the
lead then five men then me. We had moved about 500 feet when a VC
blew a Claymore mine. Sergeant Janke and Taylor were killed outright
and 3 of the next 4 were injured seriously. I patched up the three
wounded and the radio operator got in a heaven sent dustoff
(helicopter ambulance) in 8 or 10 minutes. We loaded the living and
then the dead sadly on the helicopter and sent them to the hospital
in Qui Nhion and then on to Japan. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The wait for the tracks to come pick us up gave us
lots of time to count our blessings and pray for the men. The Lt.
came around and asked if I would change my mind about being a
conscientious objector. I told him no but he didn't understand. When
I got back to the others, someone said "Well maybe you still feel
that way now but it's 100 to 1 that you won't by the end of 12
months".</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Tell Anne and Don the news. Will write again soon.
You please do too.</font></p>
