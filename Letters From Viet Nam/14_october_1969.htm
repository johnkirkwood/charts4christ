<p><font size="+1">Phan Thiet, VN, 4 October 69 (LZ Betty)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">IMPORTANT!!!</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">What about the exposure on the slides? Are they
all over or just some or what? Perhaps it is only at high noon they
are over!? Ask John to do something. I don't want to ruin any more! I
can set the exposure meter on the A.S.A of the film to get darker
pictures but I can't until I know exactly what is going on exposures
wise. The pictures of the water should have come out better. Perhaps
the film is faster that 64A.S.A. They were shot at 1/500, F8 or
1/250, F8. I shoot normal outdoors midmorning bright sun at 1/250 F8.
Is this OK. Ask John T. Perhaps the film has lost contrast from being
old.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">About the focus situation; if there is anything in
focus in the picture, preferably an important part, it is in focus.
You will find that those pics shot in dim light are the one with not
much in focus. This is because of F1.4 there is a very small depth of
field. At 2 feet it only amounts to about 1/2 inch. If one roll of
pics is consistently out of focus and others not, it is because I
loaded the film wrong. But, if only an occasional one, it is due to
F1.4.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Please reply as soon as you get this so I can take
corrective action. John T. will be able to help.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Much love,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">John.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">P.S. There was part of one roll that should have
been under (exposed). How was it?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got your letter about the record player and the
storm and it reminded me of some things that happened to me
yesterday.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I couldn't stand what was on the radio so I turned
it to a V.N. station. Myer, whose radio it is, said to change it back
but that station was about the only good one so it played on. I was
reading while laying on the bunk and into my reading came an excerpt
from Dr. Zhivago over the V.N. station. Even though it was distorted
and papery over the small radio it was the first good music. I had
hear since I left home. I lay there in the heat shivering with goose
bumps all over just hearing it.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Another thing that happens when I am thanking God
for things, for food, shelter, safety, Donna, a promise, yes a
future, without which, all else would be small and meaningless. It
sends a shudder through me each time I think how important that
is.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Has Erin brought the B&amp;W prints yet? When he
does there should be 2 of each. Please send me 1 of each.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I read a very interesting magazine article on
traveling at the speed of light and beyond. They said that matter
couldn't travel at the speed of light (could slightly slower though)
but that particle of certain characteristics could travel from just
faster that the speed of light to infinity. Could be how God gets
around. No? </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">A particle like this would violate none of the
laws of physics that we know of. Perhaps some day people can be
changed into particles such as these and transnavigate the universe
in 2 or 3 days. Take a month's vacation and visit a couple of other
universes. It is very exciting even just to scratch the
surface.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Awaiting that day also.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Much Love,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">John.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">P.S. 2 rolls of film to send but who to send them
to?</font></p>

Phan Thiet, VN, 12 October 69 (LZ Betty)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Lots has happened &amp;emdash; so much I haven't had a
chance to write.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">4 days ago, the day before I went to Cam Rhan Bay,
we, 5 medics, were down at the amo dump filling sand bags when we all
heard a B-R-R-R-R-R-P and looked up to see a chopper with a lot of
shredded OD aluminum falling away from the tail rotor. Andy said
"That chopper is going to crash." The helicopter was a bit unsteady
for about 20 or 30 seconds. And then started to spin faster and
faster. It was spinning very rapidly when it slammed into the ground.
I felt pretty helpless as I watched it bounce up about 5' and tilt
over, catch the dirt with its rotor and tear itself to bits. Andy and
I were the first to get there but there wasn't much we could do
&amp;endash; the pilot had climbed out as had the crew chief, the door
gunner was thrown out or jumped (he doesn't know which) and was OK
but the copilot was pinned under and inside the overturned aircraft.
In 2 min. everybody and his dog was there, including Dr. Dossy, who
incidentally has gone home, M.P.s, etc. They got the copilot out and
found him bruised here and there and cut on the knee cap but
otherwise OK. All of them (4) got on the dustoff copter and went to
the hospital.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It's a wonder that no one was hurt worse, and, if
the copilot isn't lucky, no one is! There was a 6 foot chunk of rotor
where his head usually was in the cockpit. I took pictures of the
wreckage afterwards and got one of the door gunner looking at it with
a patch on his head.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The next day I flew to Cam Rhan Bay to have my
finances adjusted. They have been carrying forward my pay but I have
it set so that they pay my bank account, one I took out over here
which pays 5% interest on a checking account. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I took some pictures that should turn out good.
One of the pale sunset over brushy dunes. Another of the sea at
almost dark, one of the lights of Cam Rhan.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Please DON'T send the Troy bank $50.00 the first
of Nov. I will tell that that I will double a payment after Jan. SAVE
the $50.00 to pay the duty on the tape recorder I am ordering from
PACEX. The duty will be about $35.00 and will have to be paid at the
P.O. before you or Erin can pick up the recorder. It will be there
sometime in Dec. or so.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Will write more later.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love John.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">

</font></p><hr><font size="+1">

Phan Thiet, VN, 16 October 69 (LZ Betty)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got your letters (4) tonight and I feel like the
news of home had been piling up like slush behind a slush dam.
Suddenly breaking through and reality flooding into V.N. I will write
some comments on the back of the pictures. I hope that's
OK.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">As of today, I paid the 1970 dues to the National
Geo. So if any more notices come, you needn't send them over
here.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The nameplate was interesting with its smear but
was that intentional? If it was perhaps it would be better if it were
smeared at about a 45° angle? I don't know. Don't worry at all
about the little record just throw it away. I figured something might
happen to a record so I had the good one sent straight to you and the
cheap sample sent here. It's no loss at all &amp;emdash; it was
free.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I also have the feeling that I will be home OK. I
can think of many, many times over here that people have injured or
killed but I was somewhere else, thank God.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">There is some flat aluminum sheet, some
streamlined tubing, and one spar that I can think of. You may sell
any of them and if someone wants something else specific write and
ask. The streamlined tubing is worth on the order of $1.00 a foot so
sell it for what it is worth. I knew that engine (Kinner 5 cylinder
radial aircraft engine) was worth a lot more that what we paid for it
and I was unhappy that we couldn't make a better sale.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thanks for Ted's address.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I guess <i>coming</i> can get along with only one
"m" but <i>wonderful</i> is such a good word it deserves another
"l".</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I will (God willing) take R&amp;R in Tokyo in the
middle of Jan. I hope to get the camera situation straightened out
before that. There are rumors, but don't get your hopes up, that the
unit may go back to the states in Jan. and also that those whose
getting out on or after May 1 could get a 2 month drop, that is, get
out early.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I believe that <i>route</i> means the way or path
taken. In the poem I intended <i>rout</i>, (a defeat of the enemy) as
a restatement of the victory in the line above.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I can and will buy a slide copier with which I can
crop and duplicate my slides with an appropriate improvement.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I won't take pictures of people against the sky.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The trees here are a little, but just a little
bit, lavender, but mostly gray brown. I am beginning to suspect the
film. When I get back the film (test roll) that I sent you I will
know.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I must come home through S.F. or Ft. Lewis as the
army sends me.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am well supplied with vitamin A, B, C, D, E and
minerals thanks to you and the Raymond's fast service.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">How is the water pipe that was leaking?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">May God be with you,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love John.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got your letter yesterday that had the clippings
and announcement of Don T's partial partnership. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I sent 2 more rolls of film tonight. One should
have some good shots of a
</font><font color="#00CC00" size="+1">sunset</font><font size="+1">.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Not much happening here. The days go by one by
one.</font></p>

<p><font color="#00CC00" size="+1">Chester</font><font size="+1">, as
you will note, has only about 40 more days to go in the
army.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Tell Erin to stay out of the ARMY if at all
possible. I am sure the Air National Guard will be a better deal for
him.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">If you haven't sent them already, please send the
B&amp;W prints over here. I, and everyone else here, want to see what
the Pentax is doing. Don't forget to send the test roll on over here
also.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Sorry to hear about John T's pickup. Has he heard
anything? What will his insurance do if he hears nothing? Keep me
posed on what Erin is doing because I sent the tape recorded to him.
John T. can take care of it if Erin can't.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">What is Aleta's address?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Got a letter from Mary but it didn't say much of
anything. Will send it when I answer it.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">All for now.</font></p>

Phan Thiet, VN, 22 October 69 (LZ Betty)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Donna,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I love you, Donna; when things go badly here I
think of what you feel for me and it gives me a lot to look forward
to.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">That old word love; what does it really mean? ...
to me. Loving means being and doing together the little things and
the important ... sensing a great sadness in injustices to the human
race whether Vietnamese, Russian, Indian, or whatever; feeling great
soul filling joy with truth and honesty, with sincere and honest
people who will tell you a very sad thing, not to make <b>you</b>
sad, but because it's true; knowing that we are not perfect and can
and do make mistakes and, in all humility before God and others, ask
forgiveness.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">&amp;emdash; forgive even as they are
forgiven;</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">&amp;emdash; loving with an open trusting love that
asks nothing in return but accepts that love which is offered with
kindness and understanding;</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">&amp;emdash; crying for joy and sorrow;</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">&amp;emdash; thinking about all the multitudes of
gifts that God has given us; the best of which is love.</font></p>

Phan Thiet, VN, 28 October 69 (LZ Betty)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">You say that 2 rolls that were shot with the Lt.'s
camera were better. There are 2 reasons that could account for that.
1: the film was better (probably) and 2: it was late evening. After
those 2 rolls I bought 10 rolls of film should have been good but I
suspect they were damaged by heat and were reduced in price for that
reason but there was no notice to that effect. The next 10 rolls (of
which I am still using) were also reduced in price and also had no
explanation except that they would be outdated in a month which
should not bother the film. However, if the film had been in a hot
warehouse, as there are many over here, until close to its outdated
time, it would probably be damaged. I have set my camera on A.S.A 100
to compensate for the overexposure but it can't compensate for heat
damage. Since all pictures, whether shot at noon or dusk, were over
exposed I don't think it is the camera.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Don't worry about telling me about things that you
may only suspect are wrong with the pictures. I can do something
about it then. I don't even have any grounds for
suspicion.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am glad they found John T's pickup. I think you
will have kept me informed on what happened to it when you get this
letter.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It seems to me that there was potential vices
trying to get into everyone and only Jesus kept them all
out.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have already mailed the letter to Troy and am
waiting for a reply so don't worry about that. I will just double up
a payment after R&amp;R.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have a letter here from PACEX that says your
Christmas present is on its way; I also ordered a slide projector for
you to use till I get back. It should be there in 30 to 45 days. When
it gets there, use it and tell me how you like it. Also have John T.
make a critical examination of it. If it is good enough I may get
another for special effect projections. Tell you more about that when
I get there.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I do appreciate your efforts toward evaluation of
the pictures and I hope things got better. I may want you or Ted to
send all of the film I use over here. The exposure is the main thing.
 If isn't right, other things don't matter. I can deal with
composition when I get home. I have tried to get away from
[---] type pictures. Have I?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I haven't mailed any letters out of sequence that
I know of???</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">All for now.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">May we understand as we are understood,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love John.</font></p>

</font></p><hr><font size="+1">

Cam Rhan, VN, 31 October 69</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Yesterday, at 2:00 in the afternoon Sgt. Trotter
came into the aid station and said "Kirkwood, pack everything you own
and be over at S4 by 9:00. You are going to Cam Rhan Bay to be our
medic liaison." So here I am at the air-conditioned USO in Cam Rhan
writing to you.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I found a place to sleep at the transient barracks
(first time between sheets in 6 mos. by the way) and a place to eat
(better food and all you want). I also found a place for you to send
my mail (c/o 39th BPO, A.P.O. S.F. 96379) it amounts to a P.O. Box
where I pick it up when I can. I have my pay being sent directly to
the bank where I can write checks on it so I don't need the services
of any Co or something else to be attached to.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">When we left Phan Thiet on the chopper they, the
crew, had a couple of errands to do before going to C.R.B. I shot up
a roll of film at various settings so there should be some good
shots. I will wrap the film here tonight but I may not get it sent
till tomorrow some time.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">This whole deal of being sent to C.R.B. was a
complete surprise coming amid rumblings from Sgt. Trotter that I
would be sent out with A Co. again. I think the new Sgt. And Dr. had
some, or a lot, to do with it.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I will stop here and write Chester to tell him I
am here and not in Phan Thiet. I had invited him to come see me
there.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you all,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love John.</font></p>
