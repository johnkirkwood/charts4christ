<p><font size="+1">An Khe, VN, 1 June 1969 (LZ Uplift, in the
field)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got 2 of your letters yesterday, one dated the
24th and the other postmarked the 23rd. This is for letters with
airmail postage on them. For letters with surface postage, it takes 3
or 4 days longer. I also got a letter from Don T. , a graduation
announcement from Donna, and a card - very nice - from Andrew
Atkins.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">While I am thinking about it, please look at the
list of addresses I sent home and send me all the birth dates and
other important dates relating to these people, that is all that you
can. Donna's birth date is in my files in the envelope with her
letters. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We have moved again. This time we only moved 100
yards or so, but each time we move we must dig bunkers, dig fox
holes, fill sandbags, etc. However, this time we have the local boys
digging bunkers and filling sand bags in trade for our extra "C"
rations. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thanks for the package, though I haven't got it
yet.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">You are leaving the HQ off my address; which, I am
informed is good. The HQ only confuses matters.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Things now are much like camping. We haven't shot
at anything except for thin air for testing and at ducks (which they
should not). </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Tell Aleta I am happy for her and tell Fred
congratulations. I may have time to write to him. I expect you are
letting Aleta and others read the letters I send. That is why I
haven't written Aleta often. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The monsoons will run the temperature down and the
humidity up, which I guess is better but I don't know yet.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Take a dollar or two of the $60.00 and buy a
sickle.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am sad about the dead things (trees) but at
least we know that things that did make it will take most anything.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I haven't found any place in the world with more
beautiful weather than home. It could be warmer more often, but no
place beats it for looks. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I will be sending you the letters I receive from
time to time. You may read them and then file them away.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Must write to others...God be with you.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">love, John</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">When I last wrote I was out in the field and
things weren't too good. I guess God saw that enough was enough. So,
at this writing, I am on top of a 2103 foot mountain in what is
called the Hawk's Nest. The view to 360 degrees is excellent and I am
taking pictures of it with the Lieutenant's camera on my film. You
will probably see what I am seeing in a couple of weeks. Charlie
doesn't bother us up here because it is too difficult to get here (we
can ONLY get here by chopper). </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The accommodations are not too fancy, but the
weather is comfortable because of the altitude. It rained today with
us right up in the clouds which blew and flowed all around us.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Looking at the top of us here is what you see.

<p><font size="+1">(Map scanned from back of letter)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I received the package in excellent condition and
the plastic jar is now holding my drinking water. Thanks much for the
contents - do it again sometime.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I don't know how long I will be here, as usual, at
least 7 days. It is comfortable, beautiful and quiet so I don't mind
a bit.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Must go now and take more pictures.</font></p>

<font size="+1">An Khe, VN, 6 June 1969 (LZ Uplift, from the Hawk's
Nest)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have been thinking about something about the
people whom I was with when they were killed, especially Sg. Janke.
He and I were talking about a life after death and such just the day
before he was killed. He said that he hadn't given it too much
thought, but he thought that he would go to Heaven. I explained some
things about the thief going to paradise and so on to the effect that
paradise was here on Earth and not to be too surprised if he did not
go to Heaven. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">What I was wondering is; What are the chances I
would be present when he is resurrected? What do you think? It would
be interesting for him to wake up to a familiar face and remember
what I said.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am still on top of this mountain and will be for
4 or 5 more days. It is beautiful and cool at night and in the
evening. When I am down in the rice paddies, my world seems to be
about as big as a football field and the heat and dust seem to be the
only things that matter, but up here, I realize how big the world is
and how small the people are and how stupid war and hate are. If all
the time and money that are spent fooling and feuding around were
spent on constructive endeavors, Viet Nam would be a wonderful place
to be and the people could enjoy the beauty and the blessings that
they have.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">As it is now, there are no roads and the only
railroad that was ever built through this part of the north is blown
to uselessness and shows no sign of being fixed. The average papa
sahn, that is what all the (local) men are called, has never been
beyond his house and field and the market place, at most an
infrequent trip by bus to Qui Nhon on the only paved road there is
(the main North-South highway). </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">There are no trails, roads, paths, tramways or
anything to the top of this mountain. I would venture that, at most,
very few people have been to the top of this mountain before we
blasted the top off and put an observation post on it. The scrub
forest is too thick to walk through and is 15 to 20 feet high. The
Lt. says that the upper part of the mountain was napalmed and
defoliated prior to the engineer's work here.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Just before I left Co. A the action for the
previous 3 nights had been; on the first night a dog tripped a
trip-flare (a bright ground flare that is set off by a wire stretched
along the ground) and the whole platoon opened up with M-79 grenade
launchers, 50 caliber machine guns, M-16 rifles and hand grenades but
missed the dog entirely. The next night someone shot a dozen rounds
over our heads and again the unit opened up with everything they had.
The outcome: Three children wounded, one old man shot in the leg, and
one very small baby killed. All of them were friendly civilians.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">This brings me to another subject. Most, but
fortunately not all the GIs, feel that all the Viet Namese soldiers
and Viet Cong deserve to die on sight and since the farmer by day and
the VC by night could be anyone you meet and since the friendly
civilians don't all rush out and kill the VC and the VC sympathizers,
ALL the people in South Viet Nam are Gooks (which means strange). If
we manage to kill one gook by hook or crook it is "just
great".</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">There is "officially" a Chou Hoi program going on.
This is the open arms program that welcomes all VC and NVA (North
Viet Army) to safety if they will only put up their arms and come to
our side. However, the GI's idea is that the gook with his arms in
the air yelling "Chou Hoi" is an excellent and deserving target.
"Chou Hoi, hell. I'd shoot the (bleep) gook.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Going back to the old man and the children that
were injured; we did send them by helicopter to the hospital after I
had treated them as best I could. This won't undo the suffering and
death.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Another example of the low GI opinion of the Viet
Namese populace is a popular expression: "If you can't f--- it, Frag
it." (frag being an abbreviation of fragmentation grenade) At least
65% of the GIs have sexual intercourse with the Viet Namese and VD is
as common as breakfast. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">All of this has only strengthened my low opinion
of this useless war.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Fortunately, I am taking a vacation from the war
and strife except for what I hear on the radio messages that we relay
up here. We pass on or listen to all the communication that the Army
generates in this area. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It seems that this letter has degenerated into a
complaint sheet, but my feelings funnel into my pen because there is
no one here who understands things as I do. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I haven't heard from Chester Lamar or Fred
Singleton since the letter that you sent, but I hope to soon. I don't
get mail up here often; about once every 5 or 6 days. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Tell Karen I remember her often and Aleta too.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you all as He has with me. </font></p>

An Khe, VN, 6 June 1969 (LZ Uplift, from the Hawk's Nest)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got 2 of your letters today; one dated the 31st
of May, one the 1st of June and a letter from Don dated 1
June.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I hope that the letter that you have in hand by
the time you get this made it more clear that the officer said that ,
but had no power to enforce it and he knew it. He didn't like it ,
though, and requested that I be sent somewhere else. In the army, the
solution to problems which are told to the higher officers are
rebounded right back to the Co. commander with a stiff reprimand for
the Co. commander for not coming to him first and a complaint is not
covered by Army regulations; so it must be a personal problem. Now go
away and don't bother me any more.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The senators and people outside of the Army can
see an injustice whether it is covered in Army regs. or not and have
the power to do something about it. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am glad things are growing as well as they are
and I am especially glad that the Linden tree and the Black Walnut
tree (the one on top of the hill above the house) were not
hurt.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Tell Mike Allen hello for me and send his address
when he gets one.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">How is the water situation?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Here is my philosophy on weapons. I am not going
to have anything at all to do with weapons of any sort. I don't carry
amo or guns. I don't set mines or pass ammunition or anything else
remotely connected with killing or wounding etc. In short, the only
weapon that I will look twice at is the truth. Whatever happens to me
because of this attitude is their fault, not mine because I have a
right to these beliefs as part of my religion.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The fact is, as I have found, that when the
officer finds out that the first fire fight doesn't scare me out of
these beliefs, he will cut out that "dead wood", medic or not, and I
will probably end up in the rear area.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thanks for the mineral tablets. They came through
fine.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I did notice the Folic Acid, but as Adelle said,
It is a very small amount , by law.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Did you get the check?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I guess in the army one would call this a Sit Rep
(Situation Report).</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Your letter saying that you were sending a package
of some sort is the last one I have gotten to date.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Things haven't changed any, that is, without
warning. They said I would stay here another ten days. I wish I could
get to the PX and buy a camera and some film. The change of personnel
that I thought would replace me, but didn't, brought some people that
I went through Jungle School with. One had a TV set, portable type,
so we watched some last night. We can get 2 or 3 radio stations in
armed forces English and one TV channel also in English. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Please don't give up writing to Senator Church
because I am up here. I would still like to know what he thinks. I
haven't heard from Bro. Jolly but possibly soon. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I said in one of the letters to you that I would
number them. I have lost the sheet that I was keeping track on. I
think this is number 8 or so. Enclosed is your letter, an old one,
and I shall send you all my mail. The certified card is from the
graduation present that I sent Donna (A small gold cross on a gold
chain). Haven't had a reply yet.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you.</font></p>

An Khe, VN, 17 June 1969 (LZ Uplift, from the Hawk's Nest)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The mail is really taking a long time! I got a
letter dated May 10 from you ??!! I think you mean June 10. I got all
5 letters from you today (2 of May 27, one June 2, one June 6, and
one June 10). All together, I got 13 letters and your package. This
is due to the fact that they collect my letters and everybody else's
till they get a pile for the Hawk's Nest then bring them up here. We
had a one star general and a major up here today and I told the major
about the mail situation, perhaps something will change
.......................................................but I doubt
it.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Good news! I will get out 4 days early because the
army has to pay $65.00 combat pay if I stay the 4 days in May so they
let one go early, the 29th. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Do send the front or back or middle page of the
Idahonian, whichever has the local news. I get magazines and the
radio has national news so the world (national) news would be stale.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">About news of me or my unit in the paper or radio:
Our Unit spends most of its time taking pot shots at trees that jump
and calling in expensive air strikes about 15 minutes late on VC that
are a mile away.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am awaiting a letter a letter from Kathy Doyle.
She sounds like a very interesting person. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got the book. Very very beautiful! I especially
liked the pictures of water on the beach where the toung of water is
licking up at your feet, the one of foam floating in six inches of
water and the one of fingers of froth in the breakers, very
beautiful. I hope I can take pictures equal to them when I get a
camera. How did the pictures of the mountains come out? </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Did I get a letter from Chester Lamar at Home? If
so, where is it? Did Anne mail the book to donna? Donna says she
didn't get one so I am going to send her mine. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The cookies haven't arrived yet, but they should
be a day or two slower.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">That is bad about Don's father. I hope his diet is
up to healing it properly. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">About the paving: It is a good price and a good
idea. If you can't see it through financially, I will. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">T_A_Y_L_O_R. Do I know a Taylor? The soul brother
that was killed! No I don't know his parent's address and I don't
know if the Army would give it to me. At any rate, I can't get it
from here. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I think Karen is being tested as I am, but I don't
know what advice to give her. If it were mine to do, I would stay in
Moscow as I see no duty or other reason to go to Chicago. Perhaps
Della could come to Moscow or Seattle for a change of scenery and
therapy. You don't loose a husband like a coin. I think that Karen
would be spreading herself too thin if she went to Della and I don't
see what she could do for Della anyway. As frail as Karen's situation
is with other people, God, herself, it seems to me that Della would
be an Albatross around Karen's neck if Karen went to Chicago.
Perhaps, if Della came to Moscow, the change of pace, people and
standards would do her a world of good. Even a signed contract has a
24 hour period before it is binding. NO, Chicago is no good for
either of them. What do you mean by "contritely"?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Who found out that you get a smaller refund? Did
they send a smaller amount or a letter saying so or what?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Did you get the $60.00 yet?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">You could learn enough about a backhoe to do a lot
of good for each side of the drive, I think, but one false move near
the house could crush a wall. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Tell Aleta "Hi" if you can find her. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Tell Karen that I would like a letter from her,
problems and all. Organizing your problems into a letter can give
them much perspective. I hope that perspective would help Karen stay
home, not home but where wisdom leads.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with ALL of you.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Got your letter today and got off the hill a
little ahead of schedule by cutting my hand on a steel post. The
Medevac chopper came up and "dusted me off" so to speak. The cut is
in the thumb side of the palm running from wrist-to- fingers
direction. It is about 1 and 1/2 inches long but only about one
eighth of an inch deep. Don't worry about it because it is being
taken care of well (by me, if no one else) and it will probably keep
me out of some bad duty. I say that because that seems to be the way
God works.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Before I forget, please send me another bottle of
E. These won't last long at 6 a day for the cut.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am glad Karen came to study. By the way, what
are you studying?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I think John Talbott was away and didn't come.
Read Jeanette's letter.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Don't know that Walter whatshisname.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">You ask what one does on the mountain besides take
pictures. Answer; eat, sleep, read and write.Of course, I do odd
clean-up chores on me and the bunkers. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">About ados about nothing; 300,000 GIs rotate
through here each year. I beleive the hoopla when I see
it.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I asked in a previous letter if you got the $60.00
and I hope there is a letter on the way saying yes. But, you should
have gotten it before the 15th.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I think that after you read all my mail and the
ones I write to you, you should be one of the best informed mothers
around. I will send you the other letters when I answer
them.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you all.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">PS I got a letter from General Motors about
schollarships today. Not nuch available. Should hear from Ford soon.
Also got a letter from the company I am going to get a camera from. I
am sending the order in today and may be taking pictures by 2 or 3
weeks. Also got a letter from Nan.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">PPS Almost forgot (have already mailed the
letters). Thanks for the cookies that got here in fine shape. The
ones in the squat can are the best, the others not far
behind.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thanks for the multivitamins and sunflower seeds.
Both are AOK.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">(Should Mama be capitalized? Maybe all caps
MAMA?)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">My hand is almost completely healed and I doubt if
there will be any scar at all. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am back on the mountain, but now they have put
me in a bunker by myself. It was a lot of work, but it has its
advantages; quiet, no radios, I can fix it whatever way I want
because it is made of wood. Here is a floor plan.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">A section through the bunker looks like
this.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The rubber rain wear, drain ditches, bunk and
window I put in. The first night I didn't have the drains done and it
RAINED! Water was about an inch deep in one corner of the bunker.
Right now it is a cozy place to live and I may even paint
some.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The weather today was beautiful. There were clouds
high and very high above us and a layer below us but it was clear all
around so we could see out well. Sometimes we get caught in a cloud
and then we can't see 20 feet.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I sent off to Hong Kong for the Pentax camera
about 3 days ago I guess I told you then). Will send pics. when it
comes. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Is there some vitamin A on the way? If not, I need
some. I will enclose $4.00 to cover.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Some of the green is coming back to the mountain
top; stumps that looked dead for good are sprouting leaves. I think I
told you that the army blasted the top with napalm and defoliants
before we got here about 6 months ago. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">So long for now.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you ALL.</font></p>

An Khe, VN, 27 June 1969 (LZ Uplift, from the Hawk's Nest)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thanks for the letter of the 18th. I'm glad the
$60.00 finally arrived. You should start getting the automatic
monthly $90.00 on July 6th or 7th. Please let me know when it does
get there and also forward $50.00 on to pay for the VW. You will
probably put it all into your account and the write the Troy Bank a
check for my payment.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It is the 27th here but it is the 26th where you
are so you should have a boss by now. The tax angle sounds like it
turned out OK.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">You already know about the cookies and packages
and such (thanks again for the book) but you may have to change the
recipe to make them last longer once they get here - maybe castor oil
or something ;-) I ate the last crumbs today. Seriously they were
very good and just wierd enough to keep everyone else from eating
more than one or two.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Has it rained since the 18th?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Today is very pleasant - a cool wind is blowing in
from the ocean with bright sun. I did a wash and it is getting dry
very rapidly. Yesterday I got finished with the bunker: 4 shelves for
the amo., flares, grenades and such; 5 shelves for my stuff including
medical stuff, towel racks made from amo. box latches and cord,
clothes bar made from aluminum flare tube, tools hung on the wall and
drains &amp; waterproofing on the outside. I think I am ready for the
monsoons when they get here.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The letter on the position of conciencious
objectors from Bro. Jolly has been very helpful. When people ask why
I don't cary a weapon, I show them the letter. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">What do you mean by contritely? You have used it
twice &amp; it seemed out of context when I put my meaning on it. I
got her (Karen) card the same day as your letters. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">What did Chester have to say?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I told Karen I would send both card and letter but
I think I will send the card later. I'll just look at it a while.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John</font></p>
