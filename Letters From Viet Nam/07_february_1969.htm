<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">What is it that Karen Wants to tell me? Whatever
it is, she need not worry about what I would say. I can think of
nothing better than to have Karen love me. She is a most wonderful
person - the same wonderful person that I offered my love to once
before. So, whatever it is, say it. Not you , Mama, Karen, when she
is ready to. But let her know, for me, in some diplomatic way, what I
say here. Truthfully, I never enjoyed skating with anyone as much as
I did with Karen - never. I loved Karen very much but I had to put it
away in a corner of my heart because it wasn't accepted. It would be
very wonderful to take it out and give it away. Donna is a wonderful
person also but she doesn't understand things like Karen does.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Nothing new here - the IG inspection is the 11th
instead of the 13th - 2 days less of doing dumb things like making
sure your soap dish is within 1/8th inch of where it should be in
your footlocker. When the sarge was talking to all of us, he said he
would have to find out how they wanted the combs - with the large
teeth on the right pointing up, on the right pointing down, on the
left pointing up, or on the left pointing down. I spoke up and said
that my comb worked pretty much the same no matter how I put it away.
Everyone thought that was quite funny. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Say Hi to Fred and Aleta and Reggie but especially
to Karen.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God bless you all,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love John </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I was just appreciating your letter after a week
or so of not getting anything (except Don's letter yesterday) and the
thought hit me that you probably like to see something in your PO box
as much as I do. So I will write as well as phone. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thanks for giving Karen the rose - enclosed is
$2.00 to cover whatever expense there was. Karen has not written me -
encourage her if that is what she needs.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Don has offered to sell me their car for $600.00.
I wrote to the First Bank of Troy and asked about a loan of that
amount. I don't know whether I want to buy a car just now or not. I
probably could do it but it would take every cent I can scrape up so
I wouldn't have money for other things I want to do.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">By the way, I made SP4 yesterday (Specialist 4)
which is an extra $42.00 per month.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Did I tell you I am going to sing the Easter parts
of Handel's Masiah here at the main post chapel on Easter? Does it
say in the Bible Standard when the Passover is? </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">David and Nancy treated me to a movie (Camelot)
last weekend. It was a wonderful show but very sad. I think the
record is among those at home. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Wish Galen a happy birthday for me if you talk to
him before I do.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Tell Fred hello for me - and Aleta and
Reggie.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Did anyone clean out the heat
exchanger?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I sent off the order for 4 Divine Plans and
received them quite quickly. I gave one to Chester Lamar and one to
Fred Singleton and one to Lt. Forbes and kept one for myself.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thank you for sending the snapshot and for not
sending the slides. I wouldn't want them lost or scratched. A print
can be easily replaced if lost.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The weather here is nice 40° or so and sunny
but I don't see much of it because for the last 3 days I have been
working 16 hours a day. To bed at 12:00 up at 5:30. At least I can
nap and write letters during the day.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">May God be with you,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love John</font></p>
