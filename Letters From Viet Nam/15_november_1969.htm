<p><font size="+1">Cam Rhan, VN, 4 November 69</font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I can't remember whether I said that I got the
books or not so thanks again for sending them.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I went down to Phan Thiet yesterday on the chopper
and got a lot of mail (had to get up at 0400 hrs and didn't get back
until 7:30 pm) among which was a letter from Rick, who is going to be
transferred (perhaps to here), one from Donna, 4 from you with the
clippings, and a record from the organ people that looked like this
(45 degree bend)</font>. <font size="+1">I tried to straightened out
but it broke. I am glad that I had the other ones send to you (this
one was a gift because they didn't charge me anything but the crude
mail service did it in).</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have located the main library and found it a
good place to read, quiet and air-conditioned.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am glad to hear the Erin got the deferment and
that John T. got the pickup back and the record player is fixed but I
didn't find any slip from Vera. Did it ever get into the letter? How
much did it cost? I expect that a little rubber drive wheel got oil
on it or just got old and hard and couldn't do its job any
more.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I invited Chester to stop on his way through here
(if he comes through here) and see me since almost everyone leaves
country through here.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The B&amp;W prints haven't arrived here yet. I
hope they do sometime.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thanks for Aleta's address.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I was waiting for a letter from Kathy. Did she get
my last one I wonder?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The mail clerk said that suspicious looking
letters may be opened by the Post Office? Whatever looks suspicious
about a letter I don't know. Perhaps the pictures looked suspicious.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thanks for the rundown on the slides. It will help
till they get here. I shot a lot of the first slides at 1/200. F8 or
11, which you said was good. It was a very dark flag in the picture
(a bright navy blue) that particular shade of green should show up in
new rice fields but not much of any where else. The autumn leaves
here don't change from green and don't even fall off and storms like
the last one you saw just don't happen in Viet Nam.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I guess I will close for now.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love John.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">P.S. the cardboard mounts that Ted puts on the
slides are temporary at best. I will mount the good ones in 2 x 2"
sheets of glass which will hold the film flat and protect
it.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">P.P.S. When I was in Phan Thiet a 40 to 50 mile an
hour wind came up and blew all day. Where the arm had Army had dozed
all of the dune grass off to put the tents and such, the wind whipped
up the sand into a real sand storm. The wind was eroding the sand so
fast that when one fellow put down an army radio, the sand was blown
from one side of it and in about 10 min. It toppled over.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">John.</font></p>

Cam Rhan, VN, 12 November 69</font>&nbsp;<p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I just wrote Bro. Jolly a letter and ordered a
bible and a Divine Plan for Donna's Christmas present. I am having
them sent to you. Would you please wrap them in Christmas paper and
then brown paper and send them to Donna? I will send 2 cards to go on
the package soon so don't wrap them without the cards.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Yes, that verse that Chester quoted was a good
one, but why the sudden concern? Even the longest journeys start one
step at a time. Take each step and look around. If it was a good one,
you will know it. I still don't know Donna very well. I will work
toward that end first and then see how Christ fits in. If He doesn't
fit in her life then she won't fill well in mine. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Rickey T. is 8 minutes by air from here. I have
orders to go to Nha Trang when I get a chance. Perhaps day after
tomorrow.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">My job so far is escorting medical supplies to
Phan Thiet and picking them up here. I also help get other supplies
to Phan Thiet and related chores around here.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got the film and have shot about 11 picture so
far. Will shoot the rest soon and send it along. I am mailing another
roll now. Don't get it confused with the good one. I will mark the
good one. I haven't gotten any B&amp;W prints yet. I guess someone
though they needed them more than I did.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">About the packages you have. Set one away as it is
the twin of the first and wrap the other for Christmas. If you should
need both, say on Christmas day, you may use both. I hope you get the
projector before Christmas so you can use it then. Let me know when
Erin gets the tape recorder. I still haven't gotten any word from the
troy bank. Have you? I gather from the slip from Vern G. that the
turntable just need a tune-up. After 3 or 4 years I guess is deserves
one.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I hope things brighten up for Aleta and Fred
soon.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Much Love,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">John.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">PS. How did the pictures of the PACEX catalog come
out?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">

Cam Rhan, VN, 20 November 69</font>&nbsp;<p></p>

<p><font size="+1">20 Nov. 69</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am here in the office where I can use the
typewriter so I will write you a letter on it.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The latest thing that I have been doing was
sitting around the airport in Phan Rang. I went to Phan Thiet to take
down some supplies and the chopper had other things to do for the
rest of the day so I booked myself on a flight to Cam Rahn the next
day. The next day, the flight took off from Phan Thiet, flew a while
and sat down on a strip at Phan Rang. The plane I took out of there
didn't leave until 48 hours later. I did get a good look at the air
base there which is very large. The whole thing might fit in a five
mile square with 2 runways about 2 miles long.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I still haven't sent the film yet but I will try
to do that today. There also will be a third roll that I shot of some
people on the chopper coming (going) to Phan Thiet. I guess the best
way to identify the roll that you sent to me is by what is on it. It
will have a picture of a V.N. girl near the front and a picture or
two near the end of some high contrast islands. Please write and tell
me if it is any improvement.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got a letter from Chester and Fred on the same
day (today) in which they comment on being short. Chester has just 8
days left in the army and Fred has about 4 or 5 more. By the time you
get this, I will have 5 months left but it seems like an eternity.
Perhaps I will get that 60 day drop…!!! Rick also wrote and said
he may be stationed in Cam Rahn so I may get to see him more often
that I thought. I think I am going to be sent on an errand…so
long.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">21 Nov. 69</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I was sent on that errand. Three of the fellows
from the 1/50, two of them medics, were at the airport and need some
transportation to the army base and a place to stay for the night. I
went out and picked them up.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Today I am in Nah Trang with the fellow who drove
the 5 ton truck to get some mess hall equipment for the 1/50. We
haven't got it yet.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I haven't got much mail lately. I guess it's
because of the change of address.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">More later but I will get this into an
envelope.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Much Love,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">John.</font></p>

Cam Rhan Bay, VN, 22 November 69</font>&nbsp;<p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I think I have committed the cardinal sin, I
forgot your birthday. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">HaPpY BiRtHdAy!!! </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I don't know what to get or send. If the slide
projector gets there before Christmas, you might consider it a kind
of birthday present. Don and Ann's present to sounds like it was a
very nice one.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thank you for the descriptions of the weather at
home. The weather here never does anything like that, even at its
best.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The loan that you got from the Troy bank sounds
like them. They are almost too good to be true. Speaking of the Troy
bank, could you find out if they got my letter about deleting one
payment and if they did what was the reply. I haven't heard anything
and it's been a month and a half.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">About the mail, when I was in Phan Thiet anyway, I
picked up the mail that was there to avoid the delay of forwarding.
When I am away they do send on what comes there. No B&amp;W prints
yet. I wrote Kathy about 7 or 8 days ago so I should be hearing from
her soon.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Chester won't be through here so I guess I won't
get to see him.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Coding letters was a good idea but it didn't seem
to be getting any results. Have you missed any letters for sure?
Things sound like they are going along smoothly there, especially for
Karen. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have thought lately of going to the bible house
but I have come to no decisions about it.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Did the temple have a carpeted floor? It sounded
like it should have, or wood. But I bet it had a concrete one. Anyway
it does sound beautiful.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got a package today with a nice pocketknife in
it but it had no return address. I include it (the address) in here.
Does it strike a bell with you?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">May God be with you as he has with me,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love John.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">P.S. You spoke of a night filled with coincidence.
It does look like that at first look from our side but I am sure God
had it all planned in the smallest detail &amp;emdash; and many more like
it for you.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love John.</font></p>

Cam Rhan Bay, VN, 23 November 69</font>&nbsp;<p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got this letter from Kathy today and also got a
roll of film from Mary Kirkwood. When I went to the post office I
mailed 3 rolls of film to you.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Not much has happened around here since yesterday
except that I sang in the Chapel today. There are only 6 in the choir
and no altos or sopranos &amp;emdash; its fun though, and perhaps I will
meet someone there who likes to talk about religion.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We, the U.S.O., had a free steak fry today with
salad and cake. All was very good.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">How do you like typed letters?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Any word on the tape recorder yet?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">All for now.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John</font></p>

<font size="+1">Phan Tiet, VN, 27 November 69</font>&nbsp;<p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have been pulled back to Phan Tiet because they
need medics and for other reasons too complex to putin a letter. This
has resolved some things for me that had been bothering me in Cam
Rhan Bay. I'll tell you when I get home. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I will be going to see Rick T. tomorrow and then
to finance. You wont believe it, but, they paid me $380.00 too much.
I wish it was a bonus of some sort, but, it is only a duplicate
payment.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got a service manual for the tape recorder and
from what I can see in the manual, it will be a real pleasure to use.
Be sure to keep me posted on how things go on getting it from the
post office. Don't let it stay at the PO long or they may send it
somewhere else. Be advised the package will be 60 pounds.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got a letter from Diane S., I will send it when
I answer it, that says her father is ill and some other things are
going not too well.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">You should have gotten the film by now. Just put
the electronics parts and that slip of paper where I can find
them.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I guess this is about all. I will be home in 4
months and days, God willing.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Mat God be with you,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John</font></p>

Cam Rhan Bay, VN, 30 November 69</font>&nbsp;<p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am here in Cam Rhan Bay again, but, just for
tonight. It looks like I will keep the money at least for a while. I
went to finance and tried to give it back. So they looked in all
their records and found nothing that said I should. The money is
going in the bank and if they ever find something that says I should
return it, I will.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Rick T. and I spent yesterday afternoon and this
morning together, a welcome break from people who don't feel like I
do. I took some pictures of him on Tri-X so you should be able to see
him soon also.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Rick made me these labels on the computer he
runs.</font></p>
