<p><font size="+1"> An Khe, VN, 3 August 1969 (LZ Uplift, in the
field)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got your short letter yesterday &amp;emdash;
Thanks.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have moved again and may move today because of
my C.O. status. Nobody wants me but these people are going to see if
I can be sent to the rear. I hope so. They say the rules are such
that an honest to gosh C.O. isn't supposed to be out here.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Do send the stuff even though I am moving around.
I will get it. We may not move until the middle of Sept. and then
perhaps not to Bay Loc.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have sent 3 rolls of film now and a 4th is
exposed. The roll #4 is of the people and such around the last place
I was, a memorial service for a G.I. and some shots were I am now.
The 3 rolls should be there a little ahead of this letter.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Raymonds should pack them O.K. When I was there
they said they would send things over here for me.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Don't worry too much about the mail to me &amp;emdash;
it may be slow and go here and there before I get it but I usually do
get it.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Mary Kirkwood sent me a catalog of, the Ohio Art
School which looks interesting.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I will answer your long letter when it gets here
maybe today.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Will see you next letter.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love John.</font></p>

An Khe, VN, 6 August 1969 (LZ Uplift, in the field)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I didn't see the men on the moon but I heard them
as they made the first tracks on the moon. What do the JW's say now?
Also, I wonder what the flat earth Soc. is doing?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thanks for the poem &amp;emdash; Did you get the
alphabet? (the poetic one) </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have never seen the table you refer to by the
Edgar Bros. but I think I once saw the outside of the one great
Grandpa Westall made. It would be a help if those old charts could be
found but don't try to send them over (Xerox copies I mean). Anything
that you could Xerox would be too small to be of much
value.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">LZ (Landing Zone) Uplift is the place at which the
1st of the 50th aid station is located. Others like LZ English and LZ
North English are here and there but not necessarily close to any
V.N. town. Towns like Bong Son, Qui Nhion and Tam Quan are where the
V.N. people live.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Something happened last night and then this
morning that makes me sad and angry. Last night one of the GIs here
wanted to ride a motorcycle, which there are many of on the road, so
he flagged down a passing V.N. and forced him off his motorcycle and
rode off. He was going to come back in a short while but the
unfortunate fellow couldn't know that. The man was almost in tears
but that wasn't enough. The other GIs forced him into the bunker,
threatened him with a gun at his ear and took his money, and
intimidated him in general. In a few minutes, when the motorcycle was
back with an extra scratch on the fender, they gave him his money
back and told him to go. All of which they thought was very funny.
This morning a mama san (V.N. Woman) came in a small truck to me for
first aid. A G.I. passing in a truck had thrown a rock the size of my
fist at her. It cut a 2 inch gash completely through her cheek
knocked out some teeth and put a big bruise on her cheekbone. After
this sort of thing, which happens all the time, the official line
goes "We are here for protection of the V.N. people." Tell me another
joke!</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The army regulations state that a conscientious
objector does not have to pull guard (which means to stand on a night
watch with or without a weapon) or be on radio watch (listening to
relaying messages that come over the ANPRC-25 army radio). My refusal
to do these things, even though I am within the law, has caused much
hard feeling. I can't see any real difference in shooting a man and
pointing him out so someone else can.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Being with the C.Co. in reality does change my
address but, if I should be transferred to uplift or another Co, it
would be wrong again. With D.Co. on it, the mail does to D.Co. mail
room where they immediately write C.Co on it and forward it to C.Co.
This way takes about a day longer but saves a lot of confusion and
changes.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The "we" that is going to Bayloc, Bay Lock, Bae
Loc, or whatever, is the four Companies, A. B. C. and D., of the 1st
Battalion of the 50th Mech Infantry Brigade.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am sorry to hear about John Vars.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I guess I'll go now and write Donna and Marcia.
Will send their letters when I am through answering them.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John.</font></p>

An Khe, VN, 9 August 1969 (LZ Uplift)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Got your letters today and enjoyed very much
"Boyles Bits and Pieces". I have learned some Viet Namese, but not
much. The boys that we see speak quite a bit of english and so do the
coke girls, some quite fluent. Get rid of the Yellowjackets with a
can of bug spray, but read the label and see that you don't get one
with DDT in it. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have passed number 100 in the pictures I have
taken over here. I wonder who is paying to have them
processed?</font></p>

An Khe, VN, 14 August 1969 (LZ Uplift, in the field)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I hope I get settled enough tomorrow to write a
longer letter. I am now with the Scouts (sort of an extra Co. in
1/50).</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am sending 3 rolls of film to Erin today also.
They will explain where I have been better than a letter. I went to
Qui Nhion again yesterday and took some of my kind of pictures. We
were out in the valley for one day, then to Qui Nhion, then here to
this bridge. The fellows here are much better than at C.Co. I got 10
mor rolls of Ektachrome. So expect some more pictures. I also have 2
roles of B&amp;W.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I will tell Erin to make 2 each prints of the
B&amp;W. Send me the other of the 2.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">See you tomorrow or so.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love John.</font></p>

An Khe, VN, 16 August 1969 (LZ Uplift, in the field)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am now on, or I should say under, a bridge. The
ground is dry under here and the bridge provides shade and shelter
from the rain. I guess this is another garbage letter. The money is
now worthless because we got new money. No GI lost any money (unless
he couldn't find it when we changed) but he V.N. people lost much.
They aren't supposed to have the money so they really aren't
blameless. One woman, when they changed about 8 mos. Ago, lost
$50,000 with not 1¢ left usable.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The Chieu Hoi paper is a free passage air dropped
slip for V.C. who want to change sides.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Things are much better now with the fellows here
very understanding. We are now going to move on the 26th of Aug.
(Change # 46,293) &lt;-- small joke. Don't worry about the address.
I'll let you know if there is a change and to what. Any mail with the
old address will still get to me.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I'll take lots of pictures. Have you mailed the
package yet?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I will be home in 8 and one half months. See you
then.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama, </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">19 Aug 69</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama, </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am back at uplift now S.O.R. (same old reasons)
but this time it was an E7 sg. whom I would see only once a month or
so. He didn't want a @#%!*@ C.O. in his unit.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have an idea. Ted Cowin has a &amp;emdash; no that
won't work. If I send my rolls of film direct to you can you get them
to Ted. I am afraid that no one is going to be at the J. Talbotts.
Please write and tell me how the payment is being handled on the
processing. Perhaps I should send Ted the film direct and send the
description separate.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The roll I am sending today is of children for the
first half, a sunrise, and a village between here and the last bridge
I was on. The kids lived in the area of the bridge and enjoyed having
their picture taken. However I had to catch them off guard to get
smiles.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">All for now.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">

An Khe, VN, 6 August 1969 (LZ Uplift, in the field)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">22 Aug 69</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got your letter about the peepless J.W.s and the
Flat Earths and are glad to hear that Galen has gained some
weight.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">By the way if that little fan ever gives out it
will be because it wasn't oiled. Give it 2 or 3 drops in each of the
2 oil holes on top of the motor. You may have to give the job to
someone who is good at climbing to see the top of the
motor.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I gave the motorcyclists oppressors a piece of my
mind &amp;emdash; probably too much &amp;emdash; buy that's past. I saw the
woman about 20 minutes after it happened and sent her on to an aid
station and doctor. I did all I could for her which was clean it up
with Hydrogen Peroxide and put a dressing on it. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I spend the day today removing paneling from the
aid station so we can take it with us to Phan Thiet. Phan Thiet is
about 240 miles south of here and right on the sea. From what I hear
it won't be too bad but we still have to build the aid station and
barracks.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I enclose the first part of the poem but I haven't
got the middle yet.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Send the postcard back to Don and Anne if they
want it.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Please see if you can get me the details on the
pentax contest or, possibly better, let Don do it since he wants me
to get him a pentax.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Have you gotten the film yet?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I learned something about the V.N. language. The
time of a statement in V.N. is always the first word of the sentence.
I had heard many of the V.N. girls say "Before I go I ..." meaning,
not that she was going to do something before she went, but that
before the present she had done something; the V.N. placement having
carried into English.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Not much else going on here.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John.</font></p>

An Khe, VN, 25 August 1969 (LZ Uplift)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We are moving tomorrow and packing today. Andy, a
fellow here, and I will be driving to Qui Nhion where we will all get
on boats to go to Phan Thiet. We will be on the boats about 5 days. I
haven't gotten the package yet but it will follow me to our new home.
Since it goes by air it may even beat me there.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Nothing very super has happened here except that I
found a whole roll of the laminating plastic (same as enclosed) and
laminated all of my postcards, poems, photos, add newspaper
clippings, birthday cards etc. I just happened to have 10 or 12
sheets of heavy 10x12 glossy paper so I mounted the items all on
that. The mounting makes them all uniform and V.N. proof.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Take care.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">See you next letter.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">You probably have the change of address card now
but in case you don't have it the new address is</font></p>

   <dd><font size="+1">SP/4 - - - </font></dd>

<p><font size="+1">You may use it right away.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got the package in good shape about 18 hours
before we left. Thanks much!</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am now in Shrang valley where our trucks,
tracks, and such are getting worked on. Tomorrow at 08:00 we leave
for Qui Nhion where we will board a boat for Phan Thiet.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I slept in the jeep on a stretcher last night but
tonight I am in a bunk in the mechanics barracks. I am so sleepy I
can't write so I will sign out to be ready for tomorrow.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">How were the pictures?</font></p>
