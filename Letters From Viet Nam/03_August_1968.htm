<p><font size="+1">Fort Sam Houston, TX, 16 August 1968</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thanks for the questions. Please send me my pocket
spelling dictionary if you can find it in my desk. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Here are the answers to the questions.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">You said that the tape recorder was the best thing
that I bought and that you would like one. Well... There it is as a
Thanks Mothers New Christmas Years Day present. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am going to see the First Sergeant about
borrowing $100.00 from an Army organization (No interest to pay) to
pay Anne &amp; Don. If not, I will pay them $10.00 per
month.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got $20.00 after deductions at the first of July
and $88.00 on the first of August. I sent $45.00 to the bank
yesterday from which I will pay $10.00 to you, $10.00 to Anne &amp;
Don, $10.00 to each bank I owe (2) and $5.00 to Gub Mix Chevrolet.
Total $45.00. I make $103.00, E-1 rank, per month before deductions.
At the rank of E-2, which I should get soon, I will get $113.00 or
so.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The Gilbertson boy has not written to me at all.
Until I tell you of such correspondence, no one will ride the cycle.
I will have the title here which the purchaser must have. Please
phone the Gilbertsons and ask what is going on. The price I told them
was $340.00 with the new tire which is in the bomb shelter.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have met some nice boys and men. One or two have
become good friends - more later.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got the tracts and let a fellow by the name of
Garcia read them when he was in the hospital with pneumonia. He
enjoyed them but didn't understand much.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I think I could say almost all religions are
represented here but I have lost contact with the concentrations of
conscientious objectors. Class 24-B, with the exception of a few,
went to Co. A-3rd Bn which started a week before we here at Co. B-1st
Bn. For the past 3 weeks I have had a total of 3 or 4 hours to do
what<i> </i><u>I</u><i> </i>wanted. That explains why I haven't
talked or written to anyone. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I don't know what denomination the study teacher
is, but he seems agreeable to all views. I have written to Kappy
(Pardon the sloppy writing. I am writing on my knee sitting on the
floor by my bunk.) and I hope to hear from her soon. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I heard from Bro. Jolly by way of a nice letter
and package of nice literature.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Camp Bullis is about 25 miles from here and is the
place where all the field maneuvers are held.</font></p>

<dl>
   <dd><font size="+1">Rank:</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">E-1 is the lowest - Private (I am here
   now)</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">E-2 is also Private (here soon)</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">E-3 is Private First Class (here after
   AIT)</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">E-4 can be Sergeant or Specialist </font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">E-5 can be Sergeant or Specialist
   5</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">E-6 can be Sergeant or Specialist
   6</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">E-7 can be Sergeant or Specialist
   7</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">E-8 is First Sergeant</font></dd>
</dl>

<p><font size="+1">I don't know about JWs at Fort Sam.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I did get the vitamins from D &amp; A. Thank them
for me. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The fellows in E-4 (see first of the letter) did
not smoke as a rule, 4 out of 104. However, here at B-1, things are
not so nice as far as swearing, drinking and so on. However, you can
rest easy as far as I am concerned. We had an organization here to
stop swearing (4 members). The others gave up because I was the only
one who could keep from swearing.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The fellows are from any where; Maine to Puerto
Rico to California to Washington. I haven't talked to anyone from
Idaho.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I think the food is fairly healthful if you choose
the right amounts of the right things. It all tastes good.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Sergeant Graves, our only Sergeant now, is a real
good fellow; happy, just, considerate. But he can be severe when the
need comes up. I have made sure it didn't for me. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I entered the USMTC swim meet and got 5th place in
the back stroke. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I will be home, God willing, in 9 weeks. At that
time, or before, I will know where I am going. I will have to cut
this short so I can write some others.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Much Love</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">John</font></p>
