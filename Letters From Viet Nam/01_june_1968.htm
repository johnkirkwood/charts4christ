<p><font size="+1">Fort Lewis, WA, ~ 12 June 68</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">... By luck, I was issued a field jacket (I don't
know whether I can Keep it or not.).</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have the top bunk of the top floor of the
barracks. Weather fitfully rainy but warm. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We will report for haircuts, uniforms, and the
first tests friday, 6-14-68. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">More next time,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">PS, Don't try to write. I don't know my address
yet -</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">when I do, I'll send it. Send this on to Mama
please.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Fort Sam Houston, TX, June 1968</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">How is everybody there? I got over my sore throat,
cut my head on an electrical box and healed that up very nicely.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Life here consists of a little learning, lots of
barracks cleaning, shoe and brass polishing, eating, PT (Physical
Training), and 2 to 7 hours of sleep.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The weather is hot, 80 deg., humid 80%, and sunny
with broken clouds and wind.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">To my pleasant surprise, I found out that Basic
Training is only six weeks long because of the absence of combat
training. We don't have any leave after Basic or after driver school
which for me will add 2 weeks to Basic. After driver training, I will
go to AIT (Advanced Individual Training) for 10 weeks. At that time,
I will be assigned to somewhere (I chose Hawaii or North California)
where the Army needs me. Whether I get to go where I chose or not
depends on where the Army needs men.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Has anyone done anything to the house?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I forgot to mention that at the end of AIT I get 2
weeks leave and money for transportation to my assignment. This I can
use to go home and then to my post instead of straight to my
post.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Please send Kappy my sincere greetings and send me
any word from her. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">How is Roger? Which reminds ...</font></p>
