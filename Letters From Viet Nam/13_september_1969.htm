<p><font size="+1">Phan Thiet, VN, 1 September 69 (LZ
Betty)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It seems like a couple of months since I last
wrote but it has only been 4 days. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We have arrived safely here at Phan Thiet and have
been ushered to our new lodgings - a grassy sand lot - really! The
only things here were grass and sand. We now have tents and permanent
type quarters on the way. I have 3 rolls of film to send tomorrow or
so. They will explain what was exciting on the trip. I just decided
that there was no time like to present to take pictures and took some
of anything that looked interesting, water, sky, ship, people, jeep,
hatchway, water, unloading, loading, lifting, water, etc. I will take
some of our tent city tomorrow. I will write more when the work isn't
so pressing.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am in good health but hot and dirty until the
evening shower (they just got it up today). I am writing by the
electric lights we got up today.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Take care. God be with you.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">He is with me, I can feel it.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">

Phan Thiet, VN, 2 September 69 (LZ Betty)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Please send the books. If I stay here which it
seems I may they won't be in danger of damage.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It rains a little each day but it comes in spurts
and bursts so one can avoid getting wet usually. The temps is in the
60s at night but it may reach 90 in the day where the sun is
out.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">About the drain (if you haven't already got it
fixed) that is a faulty brass pipe and I think if you take it to the
plumbers where we got it they will replace it. John T can take it out
without much fuss.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The enclosed drawings are paper thoughts that I
want to save. Look at them if you want and put them where I can find
them.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I don't know about the shutoff. Perhaps it needs
tightening.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have been feeling rather low for a few days. I
only got one letter in the last week. That's not counting yours
today.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Take care and don't let your problems get the best
of you.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">

Phan Thiet, VN, 7 September 69 (LZ Betty)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">In answer to your questions; it was Tony's address
on the letter but so far I haven't received any reply from that
address either. The fellow in Seattle who's girl ran off is the one I
met at the info. desk in Seattle when I was looking for Eric's house.
I knew his address but I didn't know where that was.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Tell Mr. Byrd hello form me and thanks for his
thoughts.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Erin should be getting 5 rolls of film that I took
on the trip soon. The ones of the jeep with Andy that look like he is
coming off the ramp are really him backing on. I was on the jeep when
we came off the ship so I have no pics.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">What aircraft parts are you referring to? Some I
will sell and some I won't.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">How did you like the slides?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am enclosing a letter from form former Lt.
Forbes. I met him at Ft. Lewis and gave a Divine Plan.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I went swimming in the sea yesterday and took
pictures of the beach. Lots of fun. I am going in a few days to the
forward T.O.C. (?) area, a place where the high officers stay. It
should be good but I don't know. We have the bunkers done and tent up
so there is more time to write and such.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Andy (the fellow in the jeep) is a nice fellow to
know. He doesn't drink or smoke or carry on like the others. I was
going to go up to the aid station and write some letters but when I
got there Andy was feeling very glum. I quoted a lot of scripture and
when I left at 10:30 he was feeling much better.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Where in the bible does it say how old Christ was
when he started preaching? When he ended it?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Must go.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love John.</font></p>

Phan Thiet, VN, 14 September 69 (LZ Betty)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">There really isn't much to report today but I
thought you would like a letter.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thanks for sending those maps and such. I will
return them one at a time with something on them. They arrived
20¢ postage due, but no sweat. If it arrived $5.00 due no one
would collect.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We finished the wood floor in our tent today, the
aid station yesterday. The aid station is still in a tent but it has
a wood frame and walls. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I sent Donna the card and your letter. I hope your
instructions in the letter will get the card to you. I did put a
stamp on it (my last one).</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Kathy sent me a nice long letter and some excerpts
from old Watch Towers. The letter and the old letters were
wonderful.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Sgt. Trotter is a pain in the neck! Fortunately he
leaves in 82 days. Sgt. Trotter's only aim here is to climb every one
else for rank and then flaunt it around as if might (rank) makes
right (or intelligence).</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Andy (Sp/4 Anderson) left 7 days ago for 3 days
R&amp;R and just yesterday got a flight to R&amp;R center. My 7 day
R&amp;R may take some longer than 7 days.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I hope that you have the rolls of film (or rather
Erin) by now that I took on the trip down here. I sent them airmail
in a box (5 rolls).</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Not much else here worth mentioning
&amp;emdash;</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love John.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">

Phan Thiet, VN, 15 September 69 (LZ Betty)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">About the composition that you wrote about: I
assume you are referring to the slides. With the 50 mm lens that I
now have it is difficult if not at times impossible to exclude a lot
of stuff that a longer lens would exclude. It works like
this.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">[PICS HERE]</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">As you can see, as the focal length of the lens
gets longer you can get a close-up without trampling the subject to
death. All these simulated pictures were taken from the same place.
If you had come close enough to take the same pics, you would have
frightened the horse. Also, when you get close with a short (50 mm)
lens, distortion sets in and close things look bigger that they
should. The Takumar zoom 70mm to 150 mm will solve a lot of problems.
I will get this lens sooner or later. One can set the focus for where
one stands, then select the composition with a twist of the lens ring
without taking a step.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">[PIC HERE]</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have sent a roll of film with some special shots
on it home. Please have it developed and send all of the slides back
to me as soon as possible. Include a note as to which one you like
best for exposure and which one comes closest to those that you have
that are overexposed. I can't believe that all of the pictures I have
sent are overexposed when you said that some were dark and some were
too dark. What gives? I forgot to write on 2 pictures the F stop. The
one at ASA 100 is between F8 and F11 and the one at ASA 64 is at
F8.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We, the children and I, were having fun romping
and acting funny and there were scores of possible pictures that were
more natural but every time I would raise the camera to my eye to
focus they would start clowning. I shot one from the hip and some of
all the kids on the porch and one of the older fellow. How did they
come out. Were any of the trip pictures as dark as is best. If I have
over exposed more than 300 pictures I am going to be very unhappy
especially since I asked and asked how the exposure was and always
the answer was nice or some other not too definite answer. Also, I
couldn't tell the children word one about how I wanted them to
act.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Incidentally, what is the word on the Pentax
contest. I may want to enter before its too late.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Has Donna met Kathy? </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I may sound a bit upset, I am, but I think with
reason. Thanks for the advice but I don't know what to do with it
until I know what is going on. When you send the test roll back I
will know.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I guess this wraps it up for now.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love John.</font></p>

<font size="+1">Phan Thiet, VN, 17 September 69 (LZ Betty)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">About pictures: they should break down into 5
groups of equal percentages. 20% excellent pictures of outstanding
color, composition, and content; 20% textures, beautiful in color and
feel, like the chinks of metal (which were replacement tracks for an
armored personnel carrier), but just textures; 20% fairly good shots
to show V.N.; 20% not-so-good pictures of the same kind; 20% duds.
Many of the no-so-good pictures are due to unavoidable causes. Many
times I could have improved the composition if I had gone here or
there but here or there was outside the barbwire in a mined area in
most of the pictures (the 4 boxes). I had to work hard to keep
barbwire out of the frame and in all cases I was restricted to the
pavement and the shoulders of the road a few other areas (this is for
those pictures taken on or around the bridges).</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">When I learn the camera better and can control the
situation better, the last 2 percentages should decrease, ultimately
to 0. How did the close-up of granite chunks come out. I am trying to
keep the slides on the dense side so they will look good in a bright
projector. Am I? Please send them direct. I will mail a letter to
Erin at the same time so he will know when Ted gets a can of film.
The pic of blondes in pink undershirts was to show the enlightening
kind of entertainment we get here. They sang some no-so-great songs
with 3 men (traveling entertainers) but the program wasn't
photogenic. How was the shot of the spectator at the show? When I get
a long lens the small people big foreground situation will clear up
right away. With the lens I now have I have to be right on top of the
subject before it fills the frame. The red lights aren't lights. They
are tracer bullets from a 30-caliber machine-gun. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">What do the blue machines look like they could do?
What do they look like? Are they bright blue? I don't remember blue
machines. I just got some ideas of what the big blue machines are.
Were the pictures good? The machines are part of a diesel electric
plant at Phu Cat. Others on the same roll were of the air base and
surround area taken from a high tower (hence no foreground again) the
shots of the power plant were shot at one half sec. or 1 sec. held
against a post. How were they?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The little dog is a mascot but there are many dogs
here (8 or 10 in our area now). The cross was at a different (I
think) memorial service &amp;emdash; brought by the Chaplain. The V.N.
people (soldiers and family) offered the green pod for me to eat. It
looked like a better subject for photograph. I took its picture and
gave it back. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Are there any pics like [PIC] or
[PIC] or [PIC] or [PIC] or [PIC] or
other mechanical goofs?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am sad about Audrey Knight's boy.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am trying to call you again. There is a MARS
station here but I have to call when it is day here to make it night
there. I can't get away often in the day. I may call you on a weekend
when it is night here and day there but don't get your hopes up.
Things like this have a way of falling through.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We get all the world radio news and papers and
Time etc. but I haven't seen a National Geographic for a long time. I
have been noting the world situation and I wonder if I will get back
to the U.S. before Israel goes to war again, possibly for the last
time.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I bought your Christmas present today; you will
get it in 6 to 8 weeks so don't open till Christmas. It will be send
directly to you from PACEX, not from here.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">As you might well guess, I got your letter of the
10th. Thanks for the description and help.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love John.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">P.S. What do you think of V.N. so far?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">

</font></p><hr><font size="+1">

Phan Thiet, VN, 28 September 69 (LZ Betty)</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">When you get this I will only have 6 mos. And days
left over here. I will be so glad to go &amp;endash; so glad to get back
to Donna. What are your thoughts on Donna? Enclosed is the poem I
sent to her in reply to the first of the 2 letters I sent you.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Have you seen any more pictures? Did the pics of
the trip get there? </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">What were you doing when I called? Have you gotten
a package that looks like a record? If so, it is. Open it up and
listen and tell me if you like what you hear! You should get some
other odd packages and stuff which you may open but keep track of
them. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">What do you do with the $40.00 each mo.?
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Has anyone done anything on the house?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Things here kind of lurch on from day to day. I do
light repairs on the jeeps and fill a few sandbags each day. Every
other afternoon we are off to do what we like. I've been to the beach
twice but it isn't much. The biggest waves I've seen in Vietnam was
about 20 inches high. It's a dull sea.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Your Christmas present is in a fairly large box
coming in the mail to you &amp;emdash; don't open until Christmas it will
come from PACEX. Anything else you should open to see if it is
okay.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Send me a letter with questions. I can't think of
anything to write.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you,</font></p>
