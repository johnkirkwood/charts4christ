<p><font size="+1">Fort Sam Houston, TX, 1 September 1968</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It is Monday and I am on guard duty; 2 hours on
and four hours off. I am off from 6PM to 10PM. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Martha Smith is not too bad looking. I just may
get to see her in Hawaii if I go there.</font></p>

<ul>
   <li><font size="+1">Please send me some items;</font></li>
   
   <li><font size="+1">The pair of pants I sent back from Fort
   Lewis</font></li>
   
   <li><font size="+1">Any good newish permanent press short sleeve
   shirt</font></li>
   
   <li><font size="+1">The book "Human Sexual Response" by Masters
   &amp; Johnson (top of my closet)</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="+1">Send the book separately if you want to for a
lower rate. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am sending some letters with this letter. Read
them and put them away somewhere.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I just met a fellow who is a product designer from
Carbondale, Ill. (the University there). Very interesting.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Yesterday I read about some experiment on rats and
dogs breathing water. One dog went 45 minutes in the water and is
still alive and healthy.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It rained all day today. Tomorrow we go out and
carry stretchers around in the mud.
</font><font color="#990000" size="+3"><b><i><u>Ug</u></i></b></font><font size="+1">.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Training is rather dull and most of it is on a
seventh grade level. The most difficult part is staying
awake.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Do send the dictionary if you can find it. Also
send the long harmonica with the curved front - also in the desk. I
may play this one in the rhythm section when we march. Please send
also my drill press and my bed and my stereo and ... wish,
wish.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">More later</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">much love John</font></p>

<p></p>
