<p><font size="+1">Fort Lewis, WA, 1 January 1969</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Happy New Year!</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Just a quick note to let you know what is going on
here. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Chester Lamar and I along with Fred Singleton sent
in an order for three copies of "The Time Is At Hand" and have been
studying almost day and night for most of a week on everything from
Genesus to Revelations. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got $15.00 I didn't expect so here is
$25.00.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I met a very nice girl at the skating rink. Says
she will write often. I will too.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Marcia sends her thanks to me and I send mine.
Thanks for the subscription to The Bible Standard. I can use it here
and find it of interest too.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">How about it? If the angels were going to loose
the plagues on the earth for five months, would this not be 150
years? If so, the end of Jacobs trouble should be 2022 AD. Right?
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Must go. It's late and I have KP
tomorrow.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">May God be with you.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John</font></p>
