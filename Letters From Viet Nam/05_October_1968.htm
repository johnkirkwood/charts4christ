<p><font size="+1">Fort Sam Houston, TX, 6 October 1968</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Sorry this is late but now the play is over and I
will have more free time to write.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I went to the Hemisfair yesterday and saw a
demonstration from IBM. Do you remember me telling you about a TV
screen that you could draw on with a light pen and it would appear on
the screen? That is what I used to draw the design on. A computer
took it from there and told a loom how to weave the cloth. It took,
in all, perhaps 8 minutes to draw and weave; a process that formerly
took 18 to 24 HOURS. Take good care of it. It is one of 4 in the
world. I have 3. IBM has 1. I am also sending one to Erin.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I probably will not go to the convention since it
would cost a lot of money I haven't got; unless you came by car to
get me. But, don't push it. It is not that important to
me.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We graduate the 18th and I will go to Spokane and
stay with Don &amp; Anne a day or so because the plane lands
there.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Will call probably next weekend.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love John</font></p>

<p></p>
