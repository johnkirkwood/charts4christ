<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Here is a check and a poem. Send the poem back
when you are through with it. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The prefix on my name has changed to SP4
(Specialist 4) so change it on my address when you write to
me.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">You should start getting the National Geographic
soon - take good care of them since I haven't seen them. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">

</font></p><hr><font size="+1">

PS Help! I need some folic acid - I haven't had any thing green to
eat in a week. I hope the other vitamins are on the way. Some cookies
would taste good and I haven't gotten a letter from anyone
yet.</font><p></p>
