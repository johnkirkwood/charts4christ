<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I need the address of Roger H. and Ruth and Joe
H.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I went to the PO after I sent you the letter from
Cam Rhan Bay and got my mail. There was a package from Erin T., black
&amp; white prints at last, film and some creatively wonderful candy
from you plus 2 letters and a letter from Donna.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am cleaning house mail wise so I will send you a
bunch of stuff. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Things are OK here with no big news.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thank Karen for me for helping you. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Are they still thinking four lanes between Moscow
and Pullman?If so, it sounds like we might be in for some progress.
;-)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have been reading the book The Millennium which
has a lot of interesting stuff on how and why the the Greek of the
New Testament was not translated correctly. This whole process of
learning, it seems to me, would be greatly helped by pictures, graphs
and such. I have trouble with lineal thinking, that is thinking one
line of type at a time. </font></p>

<dl>
   <dd><font size="+1">You have to READ this line</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">then this line</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">then this one</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">and so on.</font></dd>
</dl>

<p><font size="+1">Seems to me that an idea could be taken in at a
glance in the overall pattern (like a flower, a map or a spider web)
and then studied in detail in each part, would be better for me. This
is something I am going to work on and think about when I get home.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thanks for the film, candy, letter and
thoughts.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">All for now. God be with you,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Not much new</font>. <font size="+1">I haven't
been able to get the mail from Cam Rhan so I haven't heard from you
in a while.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I hope that people will excuse me if I am about 4
months late with Christmas presents.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Tell Karen not to open her package till
Christmas.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">All for now,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John</font></p>

Phan Tiet, VN, 10 December 1969</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We have been busy in the last 24 hours.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Last night we heard an explosion and ran to the
aid station where we were directed to C company supply bunks. We
picked up one man with grenade fragments in his back and took him
straight to the hospital where we found a second man in bad shape. He
had lost both legs between the knee and ankle, lost three fingers and
one eye and was generally messed up. Two more were brought in later
no quite as bad. The reason for all the injuries was a VC grenade
that someone brought back to the LZ (here) for a souvenir. They took
it apart and were just setting down the parts, when it went
off.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">This morning one of the big twin rotor copters,
that fly from here to Cam Rhan Bay, crashed, killing 2 and injuring
3, but those 3 were only slightly injured. It burned only seconds
after it crashed, which was the reason for one of the deaths. (1
March 2001, The reason that it burned was that when it lost power or
control or both, it crashed on top of the 500 gallon rubber bladder
of diesel fuel that it was carrying, setting it on fire.) I took
pictures of what was left as the fire crew worked on it. The pictures
should be to you in a week or so. From what I can gather, the
controls of the chopper failed somehow and it fell from 30
feet.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got the package that you and Anne sent and am
enjoying the cookie very much. Thanks to both of you for sending
them. I will open the them on Christmas day. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am going to try to call you tonight, but, I
don't know how far I will get.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Send the Idahonian if you can take care of it
easily, no big rush.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The sad part of this death and injury is that the
enemy had nothing to do with it. Most of it, if not all, is due to
carelessness and neglect. And, by the way, none of this will ever
make the papers because it is not due to hostile action although,
that is what he army tells the next of kin.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Must go to the MARS station.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John</font></p>

Phan Tiet, VN, 14 December 1969</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It is late a just a note.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">All is well here. We just took a few mortar rounds
but, they landed a half mile from here and I don't think anyone was
hurt.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got your letter in which you said to take the
book out of the package, which I did and it is OK. Thanks much for
all the things in it. The creme has a most pleasant fragrance. I am
sending you a package of odds and ends. Send or take Don Trail the
book on Pentax. The film I am going to mail tomorrow has pictures of
the machine-gun equipped airplane that was firing tonight. I will
answer your letter questions tomorrow evening in a letter.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Must go to bed.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you.</font></p>

Phan Tiet, VN, 15 December 1969</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">A couple of days ago I loaned a fellow the book
"The Millennium" and I just got it back tonight. He was gone 11 miles
from here and wouldn't be back for 2 weeks, so I told his buddies
that I was taking the book and went and got it. I opened it to make
sure it was mine and found someone had torn the flyleaf and page one
from the book. I don't know whether they were trying to damage the
book or wanted the 2 addresses that you printed on the flyleaf. So,
if you get a letter from someone that you don't know, or a phony
looking official letter, you may guess where it came from. I think
you could tell an impersonation of my letters. Sad to see the book
torn.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">All for now.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">May God be with you.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="+1">Bob Parsons</font><font size="+1">
is a fellow who was a medic here with us but, his brother came over
here permitting him (Bob) to go back to the states. He is in Hawaii
now, but the army isn't much better there. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thanks for Ruth and Joe's address. I sent Roger's
card c/o John &amp; Jeanette, but I still want his address.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am sorry to hear about Diane's father. I don't
know what goes on between Erin and Diane. She has given me no clues
as to what she intends along that line. Don't send me anything of
great value or anything that is irreplaceable because I will be home
in 4 short months or sooner. I am glad that the slides came out well
and I will be glad to see them when I get home. Also, what I give you
for late Christmas will be a surprise to you as the book will be to
me. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">For Thanksgiving we had great piles of fruit,
nuts, meat, vegetables, eggnog, and trimmings, but they were prepared
in the usual way.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The E in E123-45-6789 stands for enlisted (they
enlisted me) as opposed to O for officers.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I also thought of Daddy when I read that address.
I wrote to him about a month or so ago, but I have heard no reply or
explanation.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Please call the troy bank and ask a few questions
for me;</font></p>

<dl>
   <dd><font size="+1">1. Did they receive a 400+ dollar
   deposit?</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">2. Have they cashed a check written to Japan
   Regional PACEX Exchange for the amount of $370.00 and one for
   $488.00?</font></dd>
   
   <dd><font size="+1">3. What is the current balance?</font></dd>
</dl>

<p><font size="+1">Both of these transactions are on the
Talbott-Kirkwood Research account.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I hope the Huchinsons know that if they have one
son in Viet Nam, the other won't have to go.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Don't worry about me going off to the Bible House
soon. It isn't a case of "I may not go at all" but "I may go". Just
something to think about as is attending 2 or 3 years at Illinois
Institute of Tech., or 1 or 2 semesters at the U of Idaho in business
law and related courses.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I really don't know how it makes any difference
whether "fullfill" is spelled with one, two or three Ls. There is no
other word in our language that even sounds the same. I am not
criticizing your correction of my spelling, just thinking on paper.
Doesn't fulfill come from the words to fill full? So why not 2 Ls
there? I look forward with great anticipation to the pure language
that God is going to return to us. Whether we assemble it in a
scientific way, use Hebrew, or accept it as a gift from God, I don't
know. I will spend much time and effort learning that new language.
To spend much time trying to be a dictionary seems to me to be a
waste of time, although I could use one more often and would if ti
weren't such a chore. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Why doesn't Karen write to me?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I hope you aren't heart broken, but I lost one of
the 2 "slides" you sent. Ha, Ha. ;-)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It is obvious that those rocks were inferior for
your uses and God had them crushed so you would not spend any more
time thinking about them (those that got crushed at least).
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Did that missing letter finally get
there?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I really would like to hear from Karen, at least
when she gets to the Bible House. She will leave for there on the
same day that I leave for Japan.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">This unit (1/50) is over here on a mission of a
curtain length of time and tat time expires in April. Your guess is
as good as mine as to what happens then, but it may be different than
the day-to-day drag it is now.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The money situation is interesting in that I was
prepared to borrow some money from the Troy Bank to take advantage of
the low prices in Japan. I am thinking of this money as a loan with a
rather uncertain repayment schedule. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The call to you on your Friday evening came after
14 hours of waiting on 4 different days. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I guess you know now about the color balance
difference between daylight and incandescent light. It also changes
from sun to shadow and from noon to 7 PM. The PACEX didn't have a
projector that would show both 2-1/4" square and 35 mm slides, only
35 mm ones. Does John T's projector show both 2-1/4" square and 35 mm
slides? </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I don't know why those slides were out of focus.
Was any part of the slide in focus? If so, ten I just didn't focus
the shot (there may not be anything close that would be in focus). I
did have one roll that I loaded wrong which could be out of focus on
one side (top or bottom) but not he other. I exposed one roll, you
may know when you see it, at ASA 400. Tell me if there is anything
good on it at all. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Look closely, I don't think that is my thumb. I
think it is part of the helicopter or the door gunner. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got an unexpected card from the Waters (DSA).
Any relation of ours? </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have been brewing some wonderful ideas
concerning the Bible, my tape recorder and slides. I can't tell you
here for lack of space, but you will see when I get there.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">All for now.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you - always.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">PS, Those exploding hot rocks were a picture of
the charcoal fire we had at the party. Any others you don't
understand?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Phan Tiet, VN, 21 December 1969</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We are having a party for the short timers today,
but it's not all that good. They are having beer, wine, vodka,
Champaign, whisky and soda, all of which don't do me any good.
However, I will get most of the afternoon off because of the party.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We got small bags of things from the red cross
yesterday. Things like soap dishes, tooth brushes, washcloths, pen,
comb nuts, etc., but the sorry thing about the whole situation was
that the lifers that delivered the bags took for themselves most of
the valuable items that we might have gotten. We never saw most of
the tape recorder tapes and good pens that were included. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">You wont get this until after Christmas, so ...
How was it?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I guess I will sign off for lunch here.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">

</font></p><hr><font size="+1">

Phan Tiet, VN, 23 December 1969</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Tomorrow will be the day before Christmas, but it
isn't anything like Christmas. There should be music in every corner
and togetherness everywhere, but they are lacking. The gifts helped,
though I think watching someone that I love open a gift is a greater
joy than getting anything. I am glad to make others happy by
receiving their gifts. I would love to see you open yours. Did Don T.
get his? I hope so. Be sure to tell John T. family and Erin in
particular that they may use the tape recorder. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I have neglected, but not forgotten Anne, Galen,
Aleta and others, not because I wanted to. There just isn't anything
they would like where I can get to it. I will bring them something,
especially Galen, when I return. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got your 4 letters with Christmas cards today,
thanks much! I gave one card to Roger Elliot who left for home today.
He is a nice fellow, but we have no plans to write. Specialist 5
Flemming also left today and left a hole in our ranks. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Yesterday I got a package of three rolls of film
back that I had sent o you on the 2nd of December and the Post Office
said "nothing wrong with this package. We will try again." It doesn't
make me happy to have air mail just wandering around in the mail for
20 or 30 days. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got a card from the VFW, I'll send you the
envelope. Is it from anyone I know?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Jim Collins also sent a card and a letter. I will
send them along. I think I will send him on of the cards that you
sent because he liked my poems so much. I think I showed him the poem
that is in the card, though I didn't have the card. So I will send
it. When I first read the note telling me to send the card to
Chester, I thought you meant the income tax card and I wondered why.
I think you meant the Christmas card that you signed. Right? Will
do.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Did you know that all the money I make over here
is tax free?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I just had a wonderful bite to eat. The sunflower
seeds are not too good alone, just seem to need something, well I
found that something in the hand of a fellow medic here that got a
package from home. HONEY! The seeds take the bite out of the honey
and the honey makes the seeds just right. VERY GOOD! Thanks much for
the seeds. I also wonder if the seeds would sprout in honey.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I sit here ... Let me tell you what I see, hear
and feel as I sit here. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">First, what I hear, because that is so important
at night. I hear chirping insects almost like crickets, an airplane
overhead, the constant rattle of the Diesel generator for the whole
place, radios, voices, and, at this instant, the PSHSHSHSHSHSHSH
..................Pow of a hand flare and an occasional
POH.................CRUMP of a mortar or the POH.................Pow
of the illumination mortar round. Now a far away jet and an
occasional PONH then a long wait and a far away </font>crump
<font size="+1">as the artillery shell leaves and finds its mark. The
M-79 grenade launcher has an odd little SHNINK.............crump. Now
another PSHSHSHSHSHSH...............FNNHP and so on through the night
even though there is no enemy in sight. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">What I see; a footlocker full of stuff that I
would throw out, turn in, and mail home if I were going home, a green
army blanket on my bunk that I am sitting on, outside through the
tent door a bright flare - now two - float down on parachutes, the
inside of our tent, the other bunks, a 500 watt light bulb that I
can't use because the base is too big, a lone red Santa sock hanging
on a strap, the rough patchwork wood floor ... </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">And what I feel; a cool breath of air (about 70
degrees or so) from the door and open side of the tent, a pressure on
my leg, from the angle iron of the bunk, from trying to turn so there
will be some light on my paper, a good taste in my mouth from honey,
a pain in my back from writing on my knees, a pain in my heart from
enforced loneliness, a longing to have a long talk with Donna and to
hear some encouraging words from her, a tiredness of war and hate,
cursing and anger, a thankfulness that it is all temporary in God's
eyes, and, if I lean back and put my head outside, I can see a full
moon playing peek-a-boo in the clouds. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">And so, with that, I'll put this in an envelope
and send it away.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Many thanks for the letters, cards, packages,
thoughts, prayers and love.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">

</font></p><hr><font size="+1">

Phan Tiet, VN, 25 December 1969</font><p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Well, here it is Christmas ... It won't be really
until I get home. We had the same meal that we had for Thanksgiving,
not bad for the Army but pretty poor by home standards. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Let me in on what other people got for Christmas.
;-)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The paper that is in this envelope is the order
that I sent for the tape recorder. I just got the letter from PACEX
today. You should be getting the slide projector soon. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Did you ever get your birthday card? I did send
one though it was late. I hope you have also gotten the $10.00 that I
sent. I haven't gotten any small packages yet.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Where are you putting all the letters that I send
you? I need one thing from among them. To get my camera through
customs, I need the invoice that says I really did buy it and not
steal it. Can you find it and send it to me? (7 March 2001, I need
not have worried about customs. They didn't even come close to
looking at what we brought home.)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">She said the dog had 2 pups, there was 8 inches of
snow and that they had made a doghouse from a 50 gallon drum. I'll
send the card when I get ambitious enough to fill another
envelope.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I guess this will be all for now.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">My R &amp; R was canceled, not really, just moved
into February so please tell Don and Anne I won't be going anywhere
on the 12th of January. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got some slides back today that I had sent out
from here to be processed (they were Kodachrome II). They have a
great deal of green in them, almost to the exclusion of blue and red
but not really. They were of some scenery, the computer that Rick
runs and 8 very wonderful pictures of the GIs watching a girlie show.
I went to see the show with some misgivings and found that the GIs
were much more photogenic than the show. With the fellows intent on
the show, they were oblivious of me taking pictures of them. I used
fairly large opening and a fast shutter to keep certain people in
focus and certain out. It worked very well as you will see soon.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am going to send them to Mary Kirkwood and she
will forward them on to you. I am doing this because she gave me the
film. I am going to keep the address of Karen's cousin and if you
think it a good idea, I ill write to her. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dave's drawings are interesting, but, I think I am
missing the most artistic part due to the Xerox.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Chester sent his wedding invite -
enclosed.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">All for now.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Love, John</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">PS, Thanks for the pictures of Galen and Anne.
Galen looks so grown up. I guess a year should make some
change.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got your package with the three rolls of film, 2
books, photo album and fruit cake - all are in good shape and thank
you very much for them and especially the books and photo
album.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I had an interesting time this afternoon. I went
down to an erosion cut that I had seen from the air and took pictures
that I think will turn out surprisingly like those of Glen Canyon.
While I was snapping away, number 20 came up in the little window and
I thought I would have to put in a new roll. I gave a crank and
number 21 came, then 22, then 23, then 24. At 24.5 it gave out. I
thought for a while it was a 36 exposure roll. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">As you can see, I changed my mind about sending
the slides to Mary. Please see that she gets to see them
somehow.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">When I got through taking the gulch pictures, I
walked out onto the beach and watched the 3 foot waves roll in. They
looked so inviting, but I didn't have my swim suit. So I went in
without. There were only 5 or 6 people on the whole beach which is
about 2 miles long and for GIs only so I am sure I didn't offend
anyone. It was so wonderful to play in and on the waves just the way
God made us. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I think the pictures of the GIs are good. What do
you think? They area bit green, though. That's why I prefer
Ektachrome.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I got a letter from Karen's Canadian friend which
was written on the 29th of May! Talk about <b>slow</b>
mail!</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Well that's all for the package.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God bless you.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Much Love John</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Dear Mama,</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We had a party today at the beach with steaks and
ribs (quite good)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">and a long splash in the ocean. It was very
refreshing and I learned a lot about how to fool the waves into
working for me instead of throwing me around.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I just (today) received a "Poor Richard's Almanac"
from Karen. Many of the sayings are quite interesting. Did you have
her party anyway or did you wait?</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">No, I don't think that I ever met Daphne
Stephenson and don't worry because I hadn't heard about them before,
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I am working behind the desk - a welcome change
from the vehicles. They are such a hassle.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Everything OK here.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God be with you.</font></p>
