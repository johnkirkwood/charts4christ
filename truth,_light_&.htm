<center><font color="#990066" size="+2"><b>Truth, Light and the
Internet</b></font></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#990066">Psalms 43:3</font> O send out your light and
your truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto your holy hill,
and to your tabernacles.</p>

<p><font color="#990066">Psalms 85:10</font> Mercy and truth are met
together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
<font color="#990066">11</font> Truth shall spring out of the earth;
and righteousness shall look down from heaven.</p>

<p><b>What is truth ?</b></p>

<p>Facts of course,but beyond the contrast of true and false there is
an allusion to the grand design wherein the powers of the universe
were commanded by the tenderness of love to form the earth and all
else that is...</p>

<p>To form a harmony, a chorus, of the infinitely intricate ...</p>

<p>A compilation of the beautiful, the kind, the finest and the best
of sentiment that God can give.</p>

<p>Truth is not bounded by the false and the dark, but is the loving,
luminous evidence of a limitless economy of power to compassionately
will every particle into the whole ...</p>

<p>An awesome and passionate provisioning of the past and future.</p>

<p><font color="#990066">Gen. 32:10</font> I am not worthy of the
least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which you have showed
unto your servant; ...</p>

<p><font color="#990066">John 1:14</font> And the Word was made
flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of
the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</p>

<p><font color="#990066">John 14:6</font> Jesus said unto him, I am
the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes unto the Father, but
by me.</p>

<p>"Full of grace and truth" means immensely more than kind to God's
creatures ("full of grace") and not a liar ("full of truth").</p>

<p>Jesus, the human reflection of the perfection of God, must have
radiated an aura of charisma,beauty, health,wit, wisdom and clever
thinking.</p>

<p>Who knows how many inventions he thought of but never spoke
of.</p>

<p><font color="#990066">Psalms 15:1</font> LORD, who shall abide in
your tabernacle? who shall dwell in your holy hill? 2 He that walks
uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his
heart.</p>

<p>Jesus was the first of those who will dwell in that holy hill.</p>

<p><b>The truth is like a wonderfully drawn, living, breathing
(almost) map. Let us take a look at its beauty and symbology.</b></p>

<p>• First we must orient the map correctly in time and space
and place ourselves correctly on the map.</p>

<dl>
   <dd>The most beautifully perfect map, held upside down, is at best
   confusing and</dd>
   
   <dd>not knowing where one is on that map makes it totally useless
   to direct one's steps.</dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd><font color="#990066">• John 8:32</font> And you shall
   know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd>Only when you understand the truth map and its symbology can
   you use it to navigate to freedom.</dd>
</dl>

<p>• The truth map and its symbols, when fully understood, show
every way, every highway, every city, every mountain and hill, every
river and sea, every rock and tree.</p>

<ul>
   <li>This, being a very clever and personal truth map, will show
   every feature, from the largest to the smallest, that is useful to
   each user.</li>
   
   <li>The truth map always updates itself to stay current and thus
   will show motion when things change rapidly.</li>
   
   <li>It is in blazingly beautiful color, and, of course, in
   3D.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Let's take a look at some of the more famous points of interest
on this truth map.</b></p>

<p>• The way:</p>

<dl>
   <dd><font color="#990066">John 14:5</font> Thomas said unto him,
   Lord, we know not whither you go; and how can we know the way?
   <font color="#990066">6</font> Jesus said unto him, I am the way,
   the truth, and the life: no man comes unto the Father, but by
   me.</dd>
</dl>

<p>• A highway:</p>

<dl>
   <dd><font color="#990066">Proverbs 16:17</font> The highway of the
   upright is to depart from evil: he that keeps his way preserves
   his soul.</dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd><font color="#990066">Isaiah35:8</font> And an highway shall
   be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness;
   the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the
   wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.
   <font color="#990066">9</font> No lion shall be there, nor any
   ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there;
   but the redeemed shall walk there:</dd>
</dl>

<p>• A city and mountain:</p>

<dl>
   <dd><font color="#990066">Zech 8:3</font><font color="#000000">
   Thus said the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the
   midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth;
   and the mountain (Kingdom) of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain
   (God's kingdom).</font></dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd><font color="#990066">Zech 8:8</font><font color="#000000">
   And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of
   Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God,
   in truth and in righteousness.</font></dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd><font color="#990066">Psalms 25:5</font><font color="#000000">
   Lead me in your truth, and teach me: for you are the God of my
   salvation; on you do I wait all the day.</font></dd>
</dl>

<p>• Rocks:</p>

<dl>
   <dd><font color="#990066">Matt. 16:18</font> And I say also unto
   you, That you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my
   church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd><font color="#990066">Romans 9:33</font> As it is written,
   Behold, I lay in Zion a stumblingstone and rock of offense: and
   whosoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.</dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd><font color="#990066">1 Cor 10:4</font> And did all drink the
   same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that
   followed them: and that Rock was Christ.</dd>
</dl>

<p>• Some trees and a paradise:</p>

<dl>
   <dd><font color="#990066">Gen 2:9</font> And out of the ground
   made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the
   sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of
   the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd><font color="#990066">Proverbs 3:18</font> She (wisdom) is a
   tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every
   one that retains her.</dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd><font color="#990066">Song of Solomon 2:3</font> As the apple
   tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons.
   I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit
   (fruits of the spirit) was sweet to my taste.</dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd><font color="#990066">Rev 2:7</font> He that has an ear, let
   him hear what the Spirit said unto the churches; To him that
   overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life <i>(or grove of
   trees which represents Jesus and His Bride)</i> which is in the
   midst of the paradise of God.</dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd><font color="#990066">Rev 22:2</font> In the midst of the
   street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree
   of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit
   every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of
   the nations.</dd>
</dl>

<p>• Rivers, fountains, valleys, pools, springs and trees:</p>

<dl>
   <dd><font color="#990066">Isaiah 41:18</font> I will open rivers
   <i>(used as landmarks)</i> in high places, and fountains in the
   midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water,
   and the dry land springs of water <i>(Restitution blessings)</i>.
   <font color="#990066">19</font> I will plant in the wilderness the
   cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will
   set in the desert the fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree
   together: <font color="#990066">20</font> That they may see, and
   know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the
   LORD has done this, and the Holy One of Israel has created
   it.</dd>
   
   <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
   
   <dd><font color="#990066">Zech 14:8</font> And it shall be in that
   day, that living waters <font color="#000000"><i>(Restitution
   blessings)</i></font> shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them
   toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in
   summer and in winter shall it be.</dd>
</dl>

<p>• Heavens, mountains and a forest:</p>

<dl>
   <dd><font color="#990066">Isaiah 44:23</font> Sing, O you heavens;
   for the LORD has done it: shout, you lower parts of the earth:
   break forth into singing, you mountains, O forest, and every tree
   therein: for the LORD has redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in
   Israel.</dd>
</dl>

<p>• The truth map is indestructible.</p>

<dl>
   <dd><font color="#990066">Psalms 100:5</font> For the LORD is
   good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endures to all
   generations.</dd>
   
   <dd><font color="#990066">Psalms 117:2</font> For his merciful
   kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the LORD endures for
   ever.</dd>
</dl>

<p><b>50 billion people in Israel?</b></p>

<p>If all the 50 billion or so people that ever lived on this earth
are resurrected and are to be taught as <font color="#990066">Micah
4:2</font> states, there must be a way to hear and see other than
being physically present to hear the truth message. Also,
<font color="#990066">Micah 4:2</font> states that "the law shall
<font color="#990066"><b>go forth</b></font>". By what means can the
law "go forth"?</p>

<p>By radio frequency signals? A TV broadcast transmitter, in Israel,
broadcasting a signal powerful enough to reach the other side of the
earth would cause serious bodily harm to any living creature near it,
in addition to sending most of its signal off to the stars instead of
to Asia. No sane person is thinking of such a plan. To solve this
problem, a digital signal could be distributed to many local TV
stations around the world where the signal levels would be more
manageable. However, this solution still omits any possibility of
personal interaction with the message and searching or forwarding the
program material is out of the question. <font color="#0066FF"><b>The
digital Internet has none of these problems</b></font>.</p>

<p><font color="#9900CC" size="+1"><b>A SONET for the
Truth</b></font></p>

<p><a href="http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/S/SONET.html"><font color="#0000FF"><b>SONET</b></font>
stands for <font color="#0000FF"><b>S</b></font>ynchronous
<font color="#0000FF"><b>O</b></font>ptical
<font color="#0000FF"><b>NET</b></font>work.</a> This is the system
for the <b>digital Optical </b>transmission of data over the backbone
or trunk lines that make up the internet. Light is guided by optical
fibers as fine as human hair or less from Israel to all parts of the
world. And from all parts of the world to Israel. And from all parts
of the world to all other parts of the world. No other "broadcast"
system can hope to do such networking! <font color="#0000FF"><b>THIS
is where light and truth come together</b></font>.</p>

<p><font color="#9933FF" size="+1"><b>Copyrights?</b></font></p>

<p>Will God Put limits and fetters on HIS truth which will "go
forth"? NO! Copyrighting a work only serves to prohibit the
distribution and/or alteration of the work unless a price is paid.
Jesus paid, on the cross, the only price that will ever be put on the
truth and light of God's word. The copyright notices that are seen in
the front of many bibles are an affront to all that was FREELY given
from God and an effort to levy a toll on a God given freeway so to
speak.</p>

<p><a href="submission_instructions.htm"><font size="+1"><b>Copyleft</b></font></a>,
which<font size="+1"><b> </b></font>prohibits charging for the text
or even its presentation and seeks to guarantee the fidelity of the
author's thoughts and words, is much, much more appropriate for the
truth and light that will flow so generously and lovingly through
Israel from our heavenly father. It is in this spirit that all the
contents of this site are attributed the copyleft status.</p>

<p>And speaking of copies, the digital media of the Internet permit
and promote copies of copies to the nth generation with complete
fidelity in every respect. The 10th generation copy of a QuickTime
digital movie will have 100% of the quality it had in the original.
The 10th generation copy of a VHS video tape will have lost most of
its program and become mostly noise. This means that the truth and
beauty of God's word will be maintained as we share it with our
friends and as our friends share it with their friends ad
infinitum.</p>
