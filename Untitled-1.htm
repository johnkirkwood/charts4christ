Dearest Terry,
<p>With every rose red leaf that trembles on its stem<br>
  I see you tremble at my kiss.<br>
  And now I may not see your love for me?<br>
  Close, dear eyes of mine, and look no more.</p>
<p>With every substance that my hand shall touch<br>
  I sense your touch upon my soul.<br>
  And now I may not feel you touching me?<br>
  Cease, dear hands of mine, from touching.</p>
<p>With every song I hear of birds or men<br>
  I hear you, love, in prayer or in care.<br>
  And now I may not hear you calling me?<br>
  Cease, dear ears of mine, from hearing.</p>
<p>With every breath of clean clear air I breathe<br>
  I hear you breathing in my arms.<br>
  And now I may not feel your breath upon my ear?<br>
  Cease, dear breath of mine, and stay.</p>
<p>With every pulse my heart beats now and on<br>
  I feel your heart beat as one with mine.<br>
  And now our hearts will beat alone?<br>
  Cease, dear heart of mine, from beating.</p>
<p>My love is yours, Terry, as long as<br>
  Sight and touch and sound and breath and pulse shall be,<br>
  As long as God gives to me this life to live,<br>
  I will love you, Terry, with every sense I own.<br>
  Peace, to you, my soul mate, till we may share as one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dearest Paul,<br>
  Wherever God may place me in this earth,<br>
  Whatever time may find in me a beating heart,<br>
  Your tender love will find in me <br>
  A haven and a sheltered place.<br>
  Whoever I may hold so dear to me <br>
  Or chance to meet,<br>
  Your touch upon my heart and kisses in my soul<br>
  Will haunt me <br>
  With their openness and warmth.<br>
  Whenever I may need to pardon one,<br>
  Your forgiveness will control my every word.<br>
  You lifted me from the ashes of despair<br>
  To love I did not know could ever be.<br>
  And should the Lord permit for us to know,<br>
  The love as man and woman both are wont to love,<br>
  I shall be yours without a backward glance<br>
  And seek within your warm embrace <br>
  A welcome home.<br>
  I’ll wait for you throughout this given life<br>
  And think it short <br>
  If God may grant for us the love you gave to me <br>
  Returning back to you.<br>
  I hold you in my warmest, softest, thought<br>
  Always and forever, my dear, sweet, love.<br>
  Till we meet again,<br>
Ellen</p>

<p>18 Jan. 03</p>
<p>Dearest Terry,</p>
<p>I have been thinking about the things<br>
  that are worth waiting for <br>
  and I have some ideas so <br>
  I will put them on paper for you here.</p>
<p>You, Terry, are surely the one person<br>
  that I will wait for as long as there is need to wait. <br>
  Your heart’s desires in all ways I find<br>
  so lovingly hopeful and humble <br>
  and looking to God in all things. <br>
  I want to walk with you in all the places <br>
  that God will send me to tenderly <br>
  and passionately share whatever is to be. <br>
  I love you, Terry, like no other.</p>
<p>A closer walk <br>
  and communion with God <br>
  in your arms and in your heart <br>
  is worth waiting for. <br>
  I wait for the day <br>
  when I can say that I have <br>
  word from God telling me <br>
  exactly what He wants for us to do. </p>
<p>I wait for your kisses, <br>
  for your touch, <br>
  for your embrace, <br>
  and for the sharing <br>
  of the intimate sensual delights <br>
  that two lovers crave <br>
  to give to each other. <br>
  I wait to enjoy all these things <br>
  in a time that urges us together <br>
  in complete peace. <br>
  Peace within our hearts <br>
  about all the relationships <br>
  that we must nurture and forgive, <br>
  peace within our minds about <br>
  our God being as delighted <br>
  at our union as we will be. <br>
  This I will wait for <br>
  as long as God requires.</p>
<p>I wait for the warmth in our hearts, <br>
  the art, the music, the words <br>
  that will come from this union <br>
  of two souls that love each other <br>
  and need each other so much. <br>
  I wait for the wonderful feeling <br>
  that the love that God has given us to share <br>
  can be shared with the world <br>
  to bring them to peace <br>
  and into harmony with God’s plan. <br>
  Actually I enjoy this now, <br>
  at least in part, <br>
  and I thank you so much <br>
  for the love you show for me <br>
  even in the distress and troubles <br>
  of the present that makes it possible.</p>
<p>The beauty of a sunset, <br>
  a tree, <br>
  a walk in the woods, <br>
  the tender appreciation that we share <br>
  in all God’s handiwork <br>
  I await with great anticipation <br>
  and a yearning in my heart. </p>
<p>The opportunity to teach the world, <br>
  with the help of many friends, <br>
  of the beauty and wonder <br>
  of God’s truth and design. <br>
  To sweep away Satan‘s world <br>
  of sorrow, greed and war <br>
  and replace it with love and gentleness. <br>
  To do this with you, I wait.</p>
<p>I wait for the soul restoring attraction <br>
  that I feel when I look into your eyes <br>
  and know that our lips <br>
  are going to meet with a passionate gentleness <br>
  and compelling desire. <br>
  The wait for this is hard, but I wait.</p>
<p>I wait for you, Terry, <br>
  through the interminable minutes and hours, <br>
  through your tears and mine. <br>
  I wait for your presence, <br>
  your sunshine, and your touch.</p>
<p>You have all my love, <br>
  dear heart, <br>
  as I wait.</p>
