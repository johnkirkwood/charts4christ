<p><font size="+1">NEW YORK (AP) - The stock market hasn't just been
falling since last Labor Day - it's been plunging, so much so that
last year's levels suddenly don't seem so bad. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">When the Nasdaq composite index accelerated its
decline shortly after Labor Day and lost 10 percent in September, no
one imagined the market would still be tanking a year later. But it
is, and the selloffs, which had been confined to technology, have
spread to the overall market. As if that weren't enough, the selling
frenzy shows no sign of fading. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"I see nothing that tells me we are at the end,"
said Gary Kaltbaum, market technician for Investors' Edge Partners.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The numbers themselves are grim. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">-The Dow Jones industrial average fell 171.32 to
9,919.58 Thursday, closing below 10,000 for the first time in more
than four months. The Dow is down about 1,200 points, or 12 percent,
from where it stood this time last year. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">-The Nasdaq composite index, whose tumbling tech
stocks ended the bull market, has lost more than 2,400 points since
then, plummeting 57 percent. It ended Thursday down 51.49 at
1,791.68. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">-The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index has lost
about 26 percent, finishing Thursday at 1,129.03 after losing 19.53.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Stocks fluctuated before closing modestly higher
Friday. The Dow gained 30.17 to 9,949.75, while the Nasdaq was up
13.75 at 1,805.43 and the S&amp;P 500 rose 4.55 to 1,133.58.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">But analysts say there's no reason to believe the
market won't go even lower - not with persisting rounds of corporate
layoffs, profit warnings and weak economic reports. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"If you are looking for something to worry about,
there is plenty to worry about," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment
officer at First Albany. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Investors' worries Thursday centered on a
government report showing consumers, whose purchases account for
two-thirds of the nation's economy, curbed their spending in July, as
well as a revenue warning from Sun Microsystems. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">A year ago, investors were just beginning to hear
primarily technology companies warn of skimpier earnings, signaling
the end of the go-go bull market. Since then, however, profit
warnings have increased, moving across the market's sectors, and
there appears to be no end in sight. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"All bets are still off. ... I have to wonder if
there is a lot more to go," Kaltbaum said. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Hopes that business and the market will improve
this year or even early next year have dimmed this week on evidence
that consumers are feeling shaky and spending less. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"There is no light at the end of the tunnel,"
Johnson said. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The Commerce Department's report Thursday said
consumer spending rose just 0.1 percent during July, an unexpectedly
weak showing after Americans began receiving tax rebate checks last
month. The news came a day after a government report showed gross
domestic product at its weakest in eight years, inching up just 0.2
percent. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">And Tuesday, the Conference Board reported that
consumer confidence dropped for the second straight month in August,
upsetting investors who had felt reassured recently as consumers kept
buying houses, cars and clothes, although at a slower pace.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">"What's probably the most disheartening piece of
the current puzzle is not only has consumer confidence continued to
decline, but personal spending has slowed," Johnson said. "That is
very troubling." </font></p>
