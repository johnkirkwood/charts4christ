<p>God made promises to His people to give them hope and vision</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Adam					Promised endless life, </p>

<p>					Had real communion with the heavenly hosts</p>

<p>					Had perfect law from God</p>

<p>					Completely enjoyable environment</p>

<p>					Loving relationship with animals in the garden</p>

<p>					perfect health and food</p>

<p>					perfect companionship with Eve</p>

<p>					started at the top and was sentenced to death</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Genesis 1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind,
and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the
earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</p>

<p>27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God
created he him; male and female created he them.</p>

<p>Promised endless life,</p>

<p>28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over
every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</p>

<p>perfect health and food</p>

<p>29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,
which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which
is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for
meat.</p>

<p>30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is
life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.</p>

<p>31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</p>

<p>Completely enjoyable environment</p>

<p>Genesis 1:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the
earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God
had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to
till the ground.</p>

<p>6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
face of the ground.</p>

<p>Sin enters the universe</p>

<p>Genesis 3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not
surely die:</p>

<p>5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes
shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</p>

<p>lost perfect food</p>

<p>Genesis 3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened
unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I
commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the
ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of
thy life;</p>

<p>18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou
shalt eat the herb of the field;</p>

<p>19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return
unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art,
and unto dust shalt thou return.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>started at the top and was sentenced to death</p>

<p>Genesis 3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as
one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his
hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for
ever:</p>

<p>23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,
to till the ground from whence he was taken.</p>

<p>24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the
garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way,
to keep the way of the tree of life.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The angels				Promised a chance to help man and failed</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Genesis 6:2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that
they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The flood				Ended the efforts of the angels.</p>

<p>					Severely damaged the ecosystem. </p>

<p>					Promised a new beginning to Noah and family. </p>

<p>					Noah and family fared no better than Adam. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Genesis 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, </p>

<p>in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, </p>

<p>the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up,
</p>

<p>and the windows of heaven were opened.</p>

<p>21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and
of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth
upon the earth, and every man:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Genesis 11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and
they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now
nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to
do.</p>

<p>7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that
they may not understand one another's speech.</p>

<p>8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of
all the earth: and they left off to build the city.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ancient worthies 		Preached the law and told of the
future.</p>

<p>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob		Promised that Israel would rule the
world </p>

<p>					asleep in death, worthy of a better
resurrection</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Christ					Christ, the promised messiah came and
died</p>

<p>					Was resurrected, departed until restitution
times</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Acts 3:21 Whom (Jesus Christ) the heaven must receive </p>

<p>until the times of restitution of all things, </p>

<p>which God hath spoken by the mouth </p>

<p>of all his holy prophets since the world began [since the
flood].</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The little flock				144000 gathered and sealed</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Revelation 7:3 Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor
the trees, </p>

<p>till we have sealed the servants of our God in their
foreheads.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4 And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were
sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of
the children of Israel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Great Company			no man can number finished and resurrected
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Revelation 7:9 After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude,
which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people,
and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed
with white robes, and palms in their hands;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The youthful worthies		an accomplished number</p>

<p>The Epiphany Campers		promise of early resurrection</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Matthew 24: 21 For then shall be great tribulation, </p>

<p>such as was not since the beginning of the world [since the
flood] </p>

<p>to this time, no, nor ever shall be.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>22 And except those days should be shortened, there should no
flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be
shortened.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>so what hope is left? 		</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Restitution!   ....of what?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Micah 4:1-4  he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke
many people. </p>

<p>And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears
into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
neither shall they learn war any more."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Acts 3:20 And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was
preached unto you:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>21 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of
all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy
prophets since the world began.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Christ					the promised messiah came again as a spirit
king and 							did a mighty Restitution work</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>chief, corner stone is laid first in the heavens and called a
foundation  stone.  </p>

<p>"built up  into him in all things."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Very much like the formation of synthetic gem stones ...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>	The little flock			 mother of thousands of millions</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Genesis 24:60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou
art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let
thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>	The Great Company		Bride's maids to do the bidding of the
bride </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>	The ancient worthies 	awakened from death perfect</p>

<p>	Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and others	</p>

<p>	The youthful worthies	awakened from death perfect</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The worthies will be ready at once for the great work before it
</p>

<p>as the human agents of the Christ </p>

<p>in restoring and blessing the remainder of mankind.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These, "Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets" and ancient
worthies referred to by our Lord and by the apostles </p>

<p>in Matt. 8:11  and Heb. 11:4-40, </p>

<p>having passed their trial, will be awakened from death perfect
men;</p>

<p>This perfection will enable them to communicate with the spiritual
Kings and Priests directly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We know that they will be human because</p>

<p>Jesus said, "Ye shall see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the
prophets, </p>

<p>in the Kingdom of God." </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When all the ancient worthies,</p>

<p>appear amongst the regathered Israelites, about the close of 
Jacob's trouble, </p>

<p>their superior mental powers will speedily distinguish them. </p>

<p>And as Jesus taught the people positively, </p>

<p>so will the ancient worthies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The news of the wonderful deliverance of Israel from their
enemies, </p>

<p>will be speedily followed by the news of the establishment of a
government</p>

<p> with ancient worthies at its head, </p>

<p>general conversion of Israel to the Messiah.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jews will be laughed at for being gullible, </p>

<p>ancient worthies will be classed as shrewd impostors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the rapid changes in Israel's welfare</p>

<p> will astonish the world, and lead many to think about</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> Isa. 2: 2-3;</p>

<p>"It shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain
			[Kingdom] </p>

<p>of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the
mountains,</p>

<p> and shall be exalted above the hills; </p>

<p>and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and
say, </p>

<p>Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the
house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we
will walk in his paths."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>For out of Zion [the spiritual Kingdom&amp;emdash; the glorified
Christ, head and body]</p>

<p> shall go forth the law, </p>

<p>and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem."</p>

<p>The flood # 2				Severely damaged ecosystem to be corrected
 </p>

<p>					Will include the efforts of the angels </p>

<p>					No meat for food</p>

<p>					No snow or cold</p>

<p>					Windows of heaven give blessing</p>

<p>					No rain</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Genesis 1:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the
earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God
had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to
till the ground.</p>

<p>6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
face of the ground.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Genesis 1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be
fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and
have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air,
and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</p>

<p>29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,
which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which
is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for
meat.</p>

<p>30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is
life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Genesis 7:11 ...   fountains of the great deep broken up, </p>

<p>and the windows of heaven were opened.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Malachi 3:2 But who may abide the day of his coming? ... </p>

<p>10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be
meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of
hosts, </p>

<p>if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a
blessing, </p>

<p>that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</p>

<p>17   ...  in that day when I make up my jewels (the little Flock);
and I will spare them (Israel), as a man spareth his own son that
serveth him.</p>

<p>The angels				will, after testing, succeed with joy in
helping man</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6 He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel
shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Adam	and all in him		will be restored from the fall </p>

<p>				RESTORED endless life, </p>

<p>				RESTORED real communion with the heavenly hosts</p>

<p>				RESTORED perfect law from God</p>

<p>				RESTORED Completely enjoyable environment</p>

<p>				RESTORED perfect health and food</p>

<p>				RESTORED Loving relationship with animals in the
garden</p>

<p>				RESTORED perfect companionship with all people</p>

<p>				GIVEN, truth, through the experience of sin</p>

<p>				RESTORED to the top and overcame death</p>

<p>RESTORED endless life</p>

<p>The word resurrection  (Greek, anastasis ) signifies raising up.
</p>

<p>As  related to man, it signifies </p>

<p>raising up man to that condition from which he  fell, </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mere awakening will be a momentary work. </p>

<p>the rest of the dead  will not live again</p>

<p>until the  thousand years of restitution and blessing are
complete.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The  perfection from which our race fell </p>

<p>is the perfection </p>

<p>to which they will rise, during the Millennial age. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The process of resurrection</p>

<p>to the complete measure of life lost in Adam will be a gradual
one, </p>

<p>requiring  the entire age for its full accomplishment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> RESTORED real communion with the heavenly hosts</p>

<p>Revelation 21:3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying,
Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with
them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with
them, and be their God.</p>

<p>4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there
shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall
there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.</p>

<p>5 And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things
new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and
faithful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>RESTORED perfect law from God</p>

<p>Revelation 20:6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first
resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall
be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand
years.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>RESTORED Completely enjoyable environment </p>

<p>Isaiah 35:1 </p>

<p>The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and
the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2 It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and
singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency
of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD, and the
excellency of our God.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3 Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4 Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not:
behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a
recompence; he will come and save you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>RESTORED perfect health and food </p>

<p>5 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the
deaf shall be unstopped.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6 Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the
dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams
in the desert.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consider the source of the water.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7 And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land
springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall
be grass with reeds and rushes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>RESTORED perfect companionship with all people</p>

<p>8 And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called
The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall
be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err
therein.</p>

<p>Consider the source of the fear and anger of the animals. The
changes in the flood.</p>

<p>9 No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up
thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk
there:</p>

<p>RESTORED perfect companionship with all people</p>

<p>10 And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion
with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain
joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Isaiah 65:17 For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth:
and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</p>

<p>18 But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create:
for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a
joy.</p>

<p>21 And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall
plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Megafarms of today</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>22 They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not
plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my
people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Landlords</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>24 And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will
answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The way it is</p>

<p>Gen 9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon
every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all
that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into
your hand are they delivered.</p>

<p>3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as
the green herb have I given you all things.</p>

<p>RESTORED Loving relationship with animals in the garden</p>

<p>Isaiah 65:25 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the
lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the
serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy
mountain, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>ALTERED  Gen 9:2 And the love of you and the delight in you shall
be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air,
upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the
sea; into your hand are they lay their heads.</p>

<p>3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be a friend for you...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zephaniah 3:8 Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the
day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the
nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine
indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be
devoured with the fire of my jealousy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zephaniah 3:9 For then will I turn to the people a pure language,
that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with
one consent.</p>

<p>Compare: ONE LANGUAGE</p>

<p>Genesis 11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and
they have all one language;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>GIVEN, truth, through the experience of sin </p>

<p>Isaiah 11:9 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy
mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD,
as the waters cover the sea.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>RESTORED to the top and overcame death</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 15:55 </p>

<p>O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</p>

<p>56 The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the
law.</p>

<p>57 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our
Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>0</p>

<p>When will it be</p>

<p>Revelation 6:10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How
long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood
on them that dwell on the earth?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PT 1981, p 75</p>

<p>	"...If we consider the length (of that generation) as 120 years
and as beginning in the Fall of 1874, or the Spring of 1878, it would
reach until the Fall of 1994 or the Spring of 1998 respectively.  We
should all realize that the beginning of the Millennial Mediatorial
Reign and the inauguration of the New Covenant after the Time of
Trouble is over, could be at, near, or shortly after the turn of the
century."</p>
